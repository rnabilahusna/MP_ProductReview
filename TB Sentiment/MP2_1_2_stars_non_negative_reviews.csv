1,bought this for my child to use as a face wash to help with small breakout in her t-zone area. it caused an allergic reaction all over her face. she had red irritated patches on her cheeks and jawline and clear lines of demarcation across her face. took her to the doctor to make sure it wasn’t a rash or infectious process of some sort to be extra cautious. after checking her over and then going over anything she was exposed to the doctor was pretty convinced it was the face wash as the culprit. she had to take some antihistamines and some anti inflammatory meds and put hydrocortisone cream on the patches for a few days and simply wash her face with warm water to let it rest and help it heal. i’m sure a lot of people use this product with no issue but i would strongly suggest a skin patch test for a couple of days before using on your entire face.caused reaction- proceed with caution.,CeraVe,"['child', 'breakout', 'tzone', 'caused', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'red', 'irritated', 'patches', 'cheeks', 'jawline', 'lines', 'demarcation', 'doctor', 'rash', 'infectious', 'process', 'sort', 'extra', 'cautious', 'checking', 'exposed', 'doctor', 'pretty', 'convinced', 'culprit', 'antihistamines', 'anti', 'inflammatory', 'meds', 'hydrocortisone', 'patches', 'days', 'simply', 'warm', 'water', 'rest', 'heal', 'patch', 'couple', 'days', 'entire', 'face caused', 'reaction', 'proceed', 'caution']",child breakout tzone caused allergic reaction red irritated patch cheek jawline line demarcation doctor rash infectious process sort extra cautious checking exposed doctor pretty convinced culprit antihistamine anti inflammatory med hydrocortisone patch day simply warm water rest heal patch couple day entire face caused reaction proceed caution,0.16999999999999998,positive
