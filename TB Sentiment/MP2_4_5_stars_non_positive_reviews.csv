4,"before i steam on ahead with my review i'll fill you in on skin's background so you'll have an idea what i'm dealing with. if you can't be arsed reading the entire thing, read the bottom line.throughout my teens, i had good skin. i did have the occasional breakout around my time of the month but other than that, i managed to escape acne in my school years. same deal as i got older, my skin is combination of oily and dry in some places. in the past 2 years, (i'm 24) i started getting these absolutely gorgeous breakouts just under my chin and my neck, and they were entirely hormonal, by the way ladies, if you get the odd breakout around your period, whatever side breaks out is the ovary that ovulates apparently. anyway, these breakouts where large, under the skin numbers and they were pretty painful. i'm sorry to say that i am a picker. disgusting but i find it satisfying. obviously, i am insane. after about six months of 'dude, what is that on your neck?!' i went to the doctor, who prescribed zineryt which quickly got rid off the problem.some 18 months later i moved to ny (from ireland), and october 2013 i started a different pill, cerazette, and after about 9 weeks of various other side affects (nothing major) i started to break out around my chin and lower jaw in general. proper cystic acne. painful, and didn't always come to a head. it took me a while to realize it was my pill that was causing this, it looked terrible. red, painful and just plain abysmal, for someone who never really had acne. i came off cerazette and after about two weeks, there was a small improvement, but honestly, nothing major. i came off it in around february off this year. i tried zineryt again which, to my dismay, only improved it a small amount. i also tried burt's bee's acne targeted spot treatment, which in all fairness, i imagine would work pretty well for someone who had a few breakouts, as it did clear up my skin a bit. about 3 weeks ago i was speaking to a friend and she put me onto effaclar duo. she said she recommended it to everyone and it worked wonders for her, and in fairness, her skin was worse than mine.  she said i could order it online, however the benefit of living in nyc and not a small town in ireland is that i can now easily access such things. i bought this in duane reade by the way, not amazon, but i read all my reviews on amazon before purchasing. i think it was $31 altogether, and then after i week i purchased the foaming cleanser. anyway, i applied this when i got home and when i woke up the next day, i swear there was an improvement. i was practically skipping about my apartment. over the next few days i continued using it morning and night, after i gently cleansed my face. on day 3 i noticed my skin started getting tighter, and by the end of the day in work i noticed that it had become, dry, flaky and patchy under my make up. i knew this would happen so i wasn't surprised, but still, lizard skin = horrible. i applied avene cicalfate restorative cream to my dry skin but also kept using effaclar duo, i just skipped wearing make up for a few days and the dry skin passed as quickly as it arrived.its now just over 2 weeks later and my skin is about 80% better. the effaclar duo has reduced the redness and scaring as well as controlled the breakouts, plus its brought all those horrible lurker type spots to a head. some people act surprised when something like this makes them break out, they don't seem to get that its bringing everything to a head. it has to get a little bit worse before it can get better.seeing as i've rambled on long enough i may as well mention the difference in the european version and the american, which has 5% bp, unlike the french version. i mentioned to my friend (who, living in ireland, obviously used the french version) said that she too experienced the dry, flaky skin for a few days. however, i've found that if i use this too often it slightly burns my face, which is why i gave it 4 stars. lizard skin i can deal with, a red burning face for a few minutes is a bit much for 5 stars. also, its cheaper at home, around 14/15 gbp, which even with conversion, works out cheaper. benzoyl peroxide isn't exactly known to do wonders for the skin, so after my skin clears up i'm going to get my sister to airmail some off the french version, or just stock up when i return home.the foaming cleanser is nice, but i found using both right after each other doesn't help much with the burning skin sensation. possibly my skin is a tad more sensitive than i thought it was. furthermore, i've increased my water intake in an attempt to improve my skin, but bottom line, i'm pretty sure its the effaclar duo that's doing the hard work. pretty soon i hope to stop using my heavy duty mac concealer. speaking of which, i've also made sure i apply said concealer with clean brushes and sponges.apologies for long review, long & short off it, i recommend you

4,"if your skin is too sensitive for retinol you should try this. apparently jumping right in using a retinol cream every night was a bad idea. my skin rebelled and i screwed up the moisture barrier. so i put that cream aside, rebalanced my skin by being extra gentle and tried this serum. 1 my skin is sensitive, 2 my skin is normally on the drier side. 3 i occasionally get pimples along my jaw line during my period.when i was half way through this bottle i noticed my pores looked more clear and less clogged which gave them the appearance of being smaller, which they don't get smaller just less noticable. i suffer from massively clogged pores specifically on my nose. they always looked dirty. they were less so now. i didn't experience any dryness or irritation. if you do i suggest using a hyaluronic acid serum before this one and giving it time to soak in. i've done that here and there on drier skin days. by the end of the bottle i noticed some unevenness in skin texture was smoothing out and darker scars from acne were ever so slightly lightening up.i have a bad habit of not giving products enough time to work and moving on bc i want instant results, yeah not smart. because this is a much gentler form of retinol it will take longer to see full results but i've already started using my second bottle and that wonderful horizontal worry line on my forehead is ever so slowly becoming less noticable.bc of how sensitive my skin is i was afraid i would never be able to use a retinol product bc i've tried many with disastrous results even when i used them once or twice a week.cerave knows how to take care of skin, they know how to create products that work effectively for all skin types without damaging your skin in the process. you just need to figure out what your skin needs and check out their line of products. i didn't notice any particular scent but as far as i know they do not add fragrance to any of their products which i appreciate bc my skin does not like fragrance even if my nose does.when i run out of this product i will be repurchasing and i use this in conjunction with the cerave skin renewing night cream or the original cerave moisturizing cream at night if my skin is particularly dry.my skin, at 33 looks better now than 5 years ago bc i'm making an effort to take care of it. i wish i had back as a teenager but maybe anybody reading this will think about taking care of it better bc it's never too late to start. last thing, i always wear a sunscreen during the day. i'm not a foundation fan but i love the cerave tinted sunscreen. it offers the right tint to even out my complexion while still protecting. it's on the moisturizing side so give it a few minutes to soak in or use a little setting powder and your good to go.also, the tinted sunscreen is not great for darker skin people, i'm pretty pale, so if cerave could expand that line to include a larger range of skin tones that would be so helpful.a

4,"i bought this on a whim as i was running out of my usual cleanser (that i buy imported from japan), and my friend recommended to me.  i have to admit, i have mixed feelings about this cleanser.to preface, i am asian with oily skin, but i'm of the opinion that oily skin is a result of skin dehydration, so i don't mind (and in fact often use) moisturizing products for my skincare.  here are my thoughts as an oily skin gal using this cleanser- it doesn't foam up, but has a gel-like lotiony consistency, spreads easily on face, and very gentle.- i don't think it cleans as well as my old cleanser, but it's somewhat to be expected as this is meant to be gentle and non-stripping if it's going to work for dry and sensitive skin.  however, it's not to say that it doesn't clean my face - but it doesn't give me that squeaky clean feeling- in fact, i feel like it leaves a sliiiiiiiiiiiight residue/layer on my skin, which i normally would hate but in this case it's so slight, i haven't minded it too much.  however, i really do want to note that since switching to this cleanser, the pores around my nose seems to be less clean than they used to be, which is a bummer.- the residue it leaves feels smooth and a little...silicony?  there's no silicon in the ingredients but, woah i just looked at it, got a lot of alcohols, as well as sulfate and parabens.  uh...well the good news is, it haven't done anything bad to my skin!  (note that i have not done enough research to know if the particular types of these things included are all bad or not)- despite the residue feeling, i have very sensitive skin and this have not broken me out at all, so that's a great thing.- of note, when using this it seems to...make my skin feel a little weird.  specifically around my mouth area (not on my lips, but for example the skin between my nose and mouth), it kinda tingles/numbs/heats up.  it's not completely painful but it does get more sensitive the longer i keep this on my face.  that said, it has not broken me out, nor made my skin react badly afterwards.- after using, my skin does not feel stripped or dry, but i follow up with my usual toner/lotion/moisturizer anyway so it doesn't really matter.i have mixed feeling about this cleanser.  i like that it doesn't strip my skin, but i don't like that it doesn't clean as well and leaves a slight residue.  i like that the residue doesn't bother me too bad.  i don't think i like the ingredients, but i'm pretty happy that it haven't broken me out or made me more oily (which, i've tried some cleansers that really stripped my skin and made my skin feel a lot worse).  i'm not a huge fan of the consistency, but i don't hate it.  i do not like the numbing feeling, but it haven't ruined my skin either so i'm not sure its importance (there are peels/scrubs that also makes my skin burn but are obviously expected, i'm not sure if there are such ingreds in this to cause the numbing).so yeah...definitely mixed feelings on this thing lolrather difficult to describe this cleanser",CeraVe,"['running', 'usual', 'imported', 'japan', 'friend', 'recommended', 'admit', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'cleanser to', 'preface', 'asian', 'opinion', 'result', 'dehydration', 'nt', 'mind', 'products', 'gal', 'nt', 'gellike', 'lotiony', 'consistency', 'spreads', 'easily', 'gentle', 'nt', 'cleans', 'expected', 'meant', 'gentle', 'nonstripping', 'not', 'nt', 'clean', 'nt', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'leaves', 'sliiiiiiiiiiiight', 'residuelayer', 'hate', 'slight', 'nt', 'minded', 'note', 'switching', 'pores', 'nose', 'clean', 'bummer', 'residue', 'leaves', 'feels', 'smooth', 'silicony', 'silicon', 'ingredients', 'woah', 'looked', 'alcohols', 'sulfate', 'parabens', 'uh', 'news', 'nt', 'bad', 'note', 'not', 'types', 'included', 'bad', 'not', 'residue', 'not', 'broken', 'note', 'weird', 'mouth', 'not', 'lips', 'nose', 'mouth', 'kinda', 'tinglesnumbsheats', 'not', 'completely', 'painful', 'not', 'broken', 'react', 'badly', 'not', 'stripped', 'follow', 'usual', 'tonerlotionmoisturizer', 'nt', 'matter i', 'mixed', 'nt', 'strip', 'nt', 'nt', 'clean', 'leaves', 'slight', 'residue', 'residue', 'nt', 'bother', 'bad', 'nt', 'ingredients', 'pretty', 'happy', 'nt', 'broken', 'cleansers', 'stripped', 'worse', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'consistency', 'nt', 'hate', 'not', 'numbing', 'nt', 'ruined', 'not', 'peelsscrubs', 'burn', 'expected', 'not', 'ingreds', 'numbing', 'yeah', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'lolrather', 'difficult']",running usual imported japan friend recommended admit mixed feeling cleanser to preface asian opinion result dehydration nt mind product gal nt gellike lotiony consistency spread easily gentle nt clean expected meant gentle nonstripping not nt clean nt squeaky clean leaf sliiiiiiiiiiiight residuelayer hate slight nt minded note switching pore nose clean bummer residue leaf feel smooth silicony silicon ingredient woah looked alcohol sulfate parabens uh news nt bad note not type included bad not residue not broken note weird mouth not lip nose mouth kinda tinglesnumbsheats not completely painful not broken react badly not stripped follow usual tonerlotionmoisturizer nt matter i mixed nt strip nt nt clean leaf slight residue residue nt bother bad nt ingredient pretty happy nt broken cleanser stripped worse not huge fan consistency nt hate not numbing nt ruined not peelsscrubs burn expected not ingreds numbing yeah mixed feeling lolrather difficult,-0.05735294117647058,negative

5,"i keep coming back to this unassuming cleanser every time my skin gets the winter blues. for reference:i have oily, combination, with dry patches (overusing tretinoin 0.1) skin and i love heavy skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. so i use embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as i felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault i’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so i started switching to gentler products, taking a page from french skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better. so i randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. i tried it for a few days and i hated it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. so i did with it what i did with other hated products—i put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. but, after a year or so i decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from youtube derms. and i decided to actually give it a try. because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.after trying a few weeks i loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. it would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. my skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like sahara desert. it really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that i know my skin can use during the colder months. i never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. it soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight. the only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, i use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. i usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so i can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. i’m used to it now not lathering and i’m fine with it. you can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. i’m a convert believer!skincare staple for a reason",CeraVe,"['coming',

skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. so i use embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as i felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault i’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so i started switching to gentler products, taking a page from french skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better.i randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. i tried it for a few days and i hated it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. so i did with it what i did with other hated products—i put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. but, after a year or so i decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from youtube derms. and i decided to actually give it a try. because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.after trying a few weeks i loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. it would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. my skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like sahara desert. it really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that i know my skin can use during the colder months. i never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. it soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight.the only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, i use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. i usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so i can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. i’m used to it now not lathering and i’m fine with it. you can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. i’m a convert believer!skincare staple for a reason",CeraVe,"['coming',
