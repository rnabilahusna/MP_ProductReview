# ðŸŽ“ My Master Project

## Overview

My master project is titled **"Sentiment Analysis on Skincare Product Reviews in Amazon Platform"**.  
It was completed as part of my Master's degree program at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)** under the **Faculty of Computing**.  

The project focuses on analyzing how consumers from two cosmetics brands perceive and make choices regarding cosmetics based on factors like **price** and **brand reputation**.  
The objective is to help consumers make more **informed purchasing decisions** by understanding general sentiment trends.  

This includes a comparison between **local, budget-friendly skincare products** and **well-known, expensive products**, using **sentiment analysis techniques** to categorize and indicate the overall consumer sentiment reflected in product reviews.

# ðŸ›’ Amazon Product Review Scraper

This is a **Python script** for scraping product reviews from Amazon.

## âœ¨ Project Description

This project collects and analyzes product reviews on Amazon to gain insights into **customer feedback**, **product ratings**, and **trends**.  
It serves as a **web scraping tool** that allows automated retrieval and storage of Amazon product reviews in a **CSV** file for further sentiment analysis.  

By providing a **product name** and **ID**, users can easily scrape reviews, which are then processed and cleaned for downstream tasks like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning modeling**.
