Great every day moisturizer, but not rich enough for night time routine.",4.0,I likes this enough- it's fragrance free and soothing. But I may go back to the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer for night. This moisturizer is not rich and doesn't seem to deeply moisturize like the Clinique lotion does.,4

Not for VERY DRY SKIN or Hypothyroidism!",4.0,"I've recently been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism (Low Thyroid) which I'm finding out wreaks absolute havoc on your whole body, like your internal thermostat.  You get hot flashes (not menopause-induced) which last from 15-20 minutes to hours!  My skin has gone from DRY to SAHARA DRY RED and SUPER SENSITIVE. It even swells up like I'm having an allergic reaction.I purchased this hoping it would ease the redness, prickliness and repair my skin before it gets too bad since I'm still a young person.  However, as moisturizing as this is, it did nothing for the dryness, redness or prickliness.  But due to it moisturizing very well, I'm certain it will help with those that deal with dryness and/or sensitive skin only.You do get a LOT of product for the price so it's also a very good value.Still trying to find products that will suit now that I have to re-do my morning and night skincare routine. So, had to return.  Luckily, Amazon is GREAT when it comes to refunds.  Otherwise, I'd be spending some serious bank!",5

Very nice!",4.0,"The moment i opened the package the box was damaged (was a bit sad, since i like to keep the packaging of skincare products) but everything else was perfectly fine! The product has no scent and it feels very thin on the face. My skin is usually very dry so i applied it immediately (after washing my face of course) and its been a day and my skin is still pretty moisturized!!

Wonderful Softening Hair Conditioner",4.0,I’ve never had a hair conditioner which works as well as advertised.  Only need small amount of product to leave hair very soft from wash to wash.

Effective!",4.0,"I've tried so many different moisturizers and this one is definitely my favorite thus far. This is such a great face moisturizer because it's hydrating and has SPF in it. One thing I've learned in recent years is that your skin will highly benefit from using sunscreen everyday... even if you're not in the sun. I always forgot that step, so finding a good moisturizer with SPF in it is so much more helpful. My skin looks brighter when using this. It feels so hydrating without that greasy feeling (which is what I was feeling with many other moisturizers). I use this morning and night! It looks like a small tube, but it actually lasts a pretty long time. I highly recommend!",10

Nice SPF product….But…",4.0,I do like this moisturizer but I have been noticing lately that it does start peeling by the end of the day. I wouldn’t recommend this for those who have super dry skin. I find too that the texture of my skin is more noticeable and peeling too. Super annoying. I will try to use less and maybe that will help. I think this would be nice for those who have oily skin. I’m more combination skin.,5

This is sun protection though",4.0,"I realized that this cream is sun protection instead of moisturizing with high SPF only by looking at the the packaging whilst holding it. I guess it will still work for me since here is a lot of sun, but yeah it is a bit off the goal I had for a new cream. With the rest I am happy and would prefer this as sun protection more than what I have because it is lghtweight, not greasy and has a nice smell. I dont have sensitive skin, so cannot rate the impact of this cream for this factor.",0

Great moisturizer, but…",4.0,"I’ve had problems with some moisturizers not doing enough for my skin and some feeling really heavy and giving me milia. This is an amazing moisturizer,  it feels great on my face and is very moisturizing without being too much, and I’m being honest when I say a little goes a long way. Just a little squeeze the size of a nickel maybe and your done. There’s a good amount of product and I know it will last me bit. Sadly la roche posay is not animal cruelty free, either they as a brand animal tests or their suppliers/third party do. Hopefully I will find an alternative that is just as good until they can be cruelty free",7

Good product",4.0,"This works very well for me. I have very  dry/sensitive skin.I don’t really understand why they are giving you a small travel size face wash when the main product is a moisturizer. I was under the impression the “included travel size bottle” was going to be more moisturizer, but it’s face wash?It does specify it in the description about the face wash, so that was kinda my bad. One of my main selling points to this product was the travel sized bottle it comes with, so I was a little disappointed when it was soap.Overall good product, just beware the travel sized container is face wash",6

Pretty good",4.0,"This is a good daily moisturizer, not amazing but pretty good.It has almost no scent, and is very lightweight. It doesn’t bother my sensitive easily-irritated skin. That being said, I find this kind of an average level of moisturizing. I usually put on two layers; one while my skin is damp and another after it dries, and my skin is still a little dry. If your skin is dry this is good for the day, but I’d invest in a richer cream for the nighttime.",28

Feels nice, protects well, but pills like crazy!",4.0,"I tried this after (unhappily) using a greasy Murad sunscreen/moisturizer combo for many years and was initially really in love with it! It doesn't smell bad, doesn't make me look like an oil slick within a few hours, and it FEELS very moisturizing on my skin. My face tends to be pretty dry, despite my best efforts to moisturize it, so this felt like a bit of a godsend.The only problem is that after about a week of using it, I began to realize that it pills quite badly towards the outer edges of my face.

It feels great, goes on easy, a little goes a long way, it's very good!However, the major issue I experience through the day is that it causes my eyes to sting like hell. I have eczema on my eyelids, so I definitely need to protect them from the sun. I notice that my Japanese sunscreen, Biore UV aquarich, does not have this issue.So, I suppose I'll be using this stuff for my face, but continuing with the aquarich on my eyelids. Sigh.",12

Good fragrance-free protective daily sunscreen",4.0,"I bought this while looking for a calming, gentle, protective face cream to help heal a bad, painful skin reaction to a retinol serum.Background on my skin: I have very sensitive, reactive skin and a naturally weak skin barrier. I occasional have very painful, red, hot reactions to skincare products, and the tops of my hands HURT if I forget to apply oil/moisturizer after hand-washing dishes.Pros: This product is very creamy and applies smoothly to my face. It feels very comfortable on my skin, and protective without excess grease/oil and without feeling heavy. It was perfect to apply right after a minimal healing morning skincare routine. It helped protect whole my skin rebuilt its skin barrier, the ceramides truly helped.Cons: I removed a star because it isn’t sealed and it pills. I apply 2 pea-sized beads of the cream, one on each side of the face, which feels fairly generous for my face size but not like too much.It obviously has plenty of silicones, you can feel it the way it smooths over the skin, and at first it seems to sink into skin perfectly. But later in the day, if you touch your face, it rubs off in tiny greyish eraser dusts. I think it dries out throughout the day and the stuff that doesn’t get absorbed clumps on top of the skin.Under makeup: I’ve been using this during pandemic house arrest, so I haven’t been layering anything over it about 99% of the days. But if I were to use any makeup over it, I would be sure to do it immediately after application of this sunblock, before it starts to dry down. And use either a damp sponge to apply makeup, I can see it pilling with rubbing motions.If you have even the slightest dry skin, use a separate water based moisturizer under the sunblock then put a light layer makeup over. I have not experienced problems the 2 times I dabbed on tinted moisturizer or light foundation, but I wouldn’t apply makeup after this dries onto the skin.Overall, it’s my daily go-to last step daytime skincare. Protects and keeps skin comfortable all day.",2

Works well on acne prone skin in my experienceUpdate: I received the old formulation the first time I bought this.

So far I love it!",4.0,"So far I love it! Came boxed and full unlike some other reviews. It is smooth and feels great on my skin. I did read some posts stating the pilling. I felt a little this morning after I reapplied but to be fair, it says to apply on clean skin. I had used it last night with other moisturizers and was fine. I did reapply it this morning over that I had used last night and I felt a little extra pilling off under the side of my chin. However, just a little and I doubt it would happen if my skin was freshly washed and honestly there were only a few spots that did that when I touched it half through the day but not on my face, cheeks or forehead.  It's super light and smooth and feels OH SO GOOD! I can't wait to see how my skin looks after using it for awhile! I also purchased the light sunscreen with it because I have to have sunscreen on when I go outside. I've had Cancerous Basal Cells taken off my nose and I don't want that to happen again! Almost 64 years of being in the sun cuz I love it! LOL",11

Moisturized my chronic dry skin without breaking me out!",4.0,"I would give this 5 stars if the ingredients were cleaner but I will still continue to buy this product because I have yet to find a clean product that actually works without breaking me out. I tried organic argan oil, organic jojoba oil, organic Shea butter and numerous all natural/organic mixtures. They either don’t fix my painfully dry skin or they cause me to break out from extremely clogged pores even when they say they’re non-comedogenic oils. Within a few days of using this my skin was no longer painful and peeling and now that it’s been a month of using it I have very few clogged pores and virtually no breakouts (I do still get one hormonal pimple with my cycle). I do still get some blackheads but for me (37 years old) that’s just not the end of the world.I don’t exactly understand why this has sodium hydroxide in it. Sodium hydroxide is the lye used for making soap and is caustic to the skin. I assume this is what causes the pilling people complain about in reviews. I noticed some pilling in the beginning and started using much less and that problem seemed to go away. You really only need to use a pea size amount.",33

I love this stuff but not sure if it’s clogging pores",4.0,"I’ve gotten blackheads around my nose a week after using this and I can’t tell if this is contributing, it might be. I used to use cerave moisturizing cream on my face but it is too occlusive for the daytime and pills under sunscreen. So I switched to this, it lies perfectly under sunscreen and the texture is a dream. Moisturizes well and has niacinimide, prebiotics, and ceramides. You get a larger tube than I expected. Only downside is I’m not sure about those pores, it could be other things changing around the same time I started this like hormones, or that I started reapplying sunscreen recently and my old single cleansing method isn’t enough for multiple sunscreen layers. I’m going to try double cleansing every night, and using my BHA 2% every night around my nose, and see if that helps and if I can keep using this moisturizer. Will update.",12

If only it didn’t pill up...",4.0,"I really like this moisturizer over all. It feels like velvet, dries down matte, and has a nice ingredient list. This seems just like the perfect moisturizer.My only issue with this moisturizer is that you have to be VERY PARTICULAR when applying it because IT WILL PILL UP.I swear, I tried a bunch of different ways to prevent this from happening but it didn’t really work out.Used a serum before hand? It pilled up. Applied moisturizer to wet skin? It pilled up. Massaged moisturizer into skin slightly longer than normal? It pilled up. I had to almost tap in this moisturizer for it to sit right on the skin. If you are using the JUST moisturizer version of this I would wait a couple of minutes (I would say at LEAST 10min) before applying sunscreen because if you apply sunscreen right after guess what, it’ll pill up.Sometimes even waiting 10min it would still pill.I still like this moisturizer but I would definitely love it if didn’t pill up into little balls.Skin Type:For context I have fairly normal skin, oiliness literally just on my nose,  and redness on my cheeks (some texture on both cheeks and slightly on forehead) which I’m pretty sure is rosacea but have yet to go to a derm about it because pure laziness. Why I think it’s rosacea? My grandmother and mother both have rosacea, I’m just assuming I have it at this point.",22

Does what it's meant to do but stings like mad if it gets in your eyes",4.0,"This product is a great tool to incorporate more sunscreen into your life and the price is right. It does exactly what it says it does when it comes to moisture and I appreciate that it is unscented. I think its claims of being ""lightweight"" really all depends on your skin. I have combination skin, and this feels a little residue-y on my face and makes my pores appear larger. But nothing layering on a good primer after wouldn't fix. My major complaint is that it stings like mad if you sweat and it gets into your eyes, or if you're squinting to the point that you tear up and it seeps into your waterline. Expect major discomfort for a few hours thereafter. I'll continue to use for the décolletage, but am still on the hunt to find that perfect spf moisturizer.",11
