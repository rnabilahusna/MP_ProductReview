On the left is the old bottle, note the lack of a small insert around pump tube, on the right is the new style bottle with the insert and anti-pump clamp installed.  Good luck.",2

Prior to CeraVe I used Cetaphil. That, is very moisturizing. Even if I didn't use it consistently, skin's moisture level would still sustain. Very disappointed.",0

Does not last",3,"This is unscented, which I really like. It is light weight, non-greasy and absorbs quickly. Unfortunately, I need to apply multiple layers of this before it relieves the dry, tight feeling on my skin. It feels nice after a few applications, but I'm going through this like water. It is just too expensive for how much I need to use. It is probably more suited to someone normal, not dry skin.",0

It's no different than ANY other lotion name brand or not. It's not long lasting, feels thin and watery when going on. The unscented is definitely unscented if that's a selling point for you.

Prefer cream",3,The cream is much better.  I won't buy the lotion again as it does not keep my skin moist.  The cream in the jar is much thicker and does a great job at keeping my skin moist for quite a while.  I really  like it,0

Not moisturizing enough",3,"This is really too dry for dry or combination skin to use in winter. Of course, this also depends on the local climate, mainly humidity. Where I live is very dry in winter, so it almost becomes totally dry very soon after putting on my face in winter. I guess for humid summer it would be okay.",0
