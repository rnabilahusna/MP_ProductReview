Allergic reaction",1.0,"I never review products but, I have to share. I bought this moisturizer because of the great reviews. After a few applications it gave me a some redness and what looked like acne so I stopped using on my face. Now, me being the non-wasteful person that I am thought well since it didn’t work out for my face I’ll use it on my body; after all it does say for hands, face, and neck. Huge mistake. I broke out in severe hives all over my hands, elbows, both sides of my stomach, and legs. It was extremely itchy and uncomfortable. I had facial swelling effecting my eye lids, bottom lip, ears, and hives on my forehead. I ended up having to get a shot of Dexamethasone at the doctor to calm the inflammation! Please note if you try it on your face and it doesn’t work out do not use it anywhere else on your body!!",0

Pills badly!",1.0,"This is still not moisturizing enough for me on my face.  And I noticed it makes some pilling when I try to put on make up.  Finally I decided just to use it up on my body.  After showering I put it on my body.  I sat down and was crossing my legs while watching TV.  I felt something gritty and kept rubbing my legs to get it off - not paying much attention since I was watching TV.  When a commercial break came, I looked at my legs and saw pilling and it had even gone on the floor.  I just vacuumed this morning and then did errands and was gone most of the day and so I am certain the pilling is from this moisturizer.  Now I know what that gritty, sandy feeling was last night on my bed sheets, too.  I’ll need to rewash the bedding, remake the bed, and vacuum the trail of pilling off the floor.  Not only is this not moisturizing enough, it also pills and makes a mess.  Would not recommend, especially for the price.",12

Not for sensitive skin",1.0,"I switched to the face wash and it's been great so I figured I'd try the lotion. I have sensitive skin and it gets dry in the winter. I used the lotion for the first time last night and my face burned and my chin turned super red. This morning I woke up with the driest skin ever and I had to put calming oil on my skin. I don't understand how the face wash can be so wonderful, but the lotion literally feels like it burnt the first layer of my skin off.",0

Not for acne-prone skin.",1.0,"This is decidedly not for acne-prone skin - it caused closed comedones all over my face! While the texture is nice and it does seem to be moisturizing, those people who get whiteheads easily should NOT use this product. It also stung a bit and left my face itchy - not terrible, but annoying enough - throughout the day. I was recommended this product by a YouTuber who is a certified dermatologist and really wanted to love this product, but I just simply can't!",2

Little bumps",1.0,I was excited to try this. I waited to leave a review to make sure of my findings. My skin is very sensitive so I don't usually put anything on my face but wanted a good moisturizer. Within a few days little bumps on my face and neck appeared. I stopped using it and they slowly went away. I tried using it only on my neck again and they came back. Sadly a miss for me. Glad it works for some but not me.,0

Just not the same",1.0,I have bought this from the store directly normally and decided to just pick it up from Amazon since I was already doing an order. I tried it a couple of times and it’s just not the same. Normally I feel like nice and hydrated but it’s not giving me that same feel. I had some left from my previous bottle and used that the next time thinking maybe im just extra dry or something but that bottle made me feel hydrated. Same bottle different size from different stores. Just weird.,3

Not recommended",1.0,"Initially: I just received it so I don’t know about how it feels on my skin but one thing I can say I am satisfied with the size.Update: Is not a moisturizer is just a sunscreen protector, it really doesn’t do anything to my face skin, indeed it gives my face skin an ugly texture this is not face moisturizer is just SUNSCREEN IT WILL NOT MOISTURIZE YOUR FACE",0

Caused rosacea flare up!",1.0,I was looking for new products to use to help my rosacea and based on the recommendations of a few different websites I bought this. It caused a horrible flare up after only two applications. It was so bad that I even broke out on my eyelids! This has dimethicone in it which I found out can irritate rosacea and people who have sensitive skin. Why would you put this in a product labeled for people with sensitive skin? I do not recommend if you have rosacea or sensitive skin.,4

Been using It for about a week, noticed my skin was considerably more oily by middle of the day and small pimples at first on my forehead and then several huge cystic like lesions arose on my neck. I got a total of about 12-15 new pimples in a little over a week. In the trash It goes!",0

Yuck",1.0,I was looking for a moisturizer that was cheaper than my current Dermologica. This isn’t it. It’s greasy and pills on your face. I was wearing it around the house with no makeup and when I rubbed my face it would turn into tiny balls of gunk. Had to go wash it off. I have ELF moisturizer that is way cheaper and works better than this stuff.,0

No bueno",1.0,"Not good for me. I was so excited bcz it has ceramide and niacinamide but when I would apply it on my skin, it would leave like a jelly coat and if you rub your face or apply something over it it’ll start to peel…Literally a nightmare! Idk if it works or not simply bcz of its texture and the fact that it peels off like as if you applied a jello scrub not a cream. Its’ consistency sucks!!",0

Caused Break out!!",1.0,"Used the product three times on my face and my whole face is covered in bumps now.After applying the product, it makes little crumbs on the skin. I've never had a face cream do that.I feel like even after washing my face there is still a film from it on my skin.I should have properly researched the ingredients. The product is listed as paraben free, however, still contains petroleum derivatives and silicone and a slew of other synthetic crap.Stick to organic and raw oils like avocado and grapeseed if you have acne or oily skin. I tried this product on a whim and it was not only a waste of money, but now I'm broken out (when I wasn't before lol). That's what I get for not realizing a product with a commercial on YouTube and social media only exists for profit.I will probably use it on my feet, though. La Roche Posay my foot.",20

So stinky it burns",1.0,I have been on a sunscreen hunt for years. The answer is EltaMD. This is oily. They all are. (Except EltaMD which dries matte). What these creators don't understand is that oily sunscreen slides off your face and takes your make up with it. I had a burned nose by the end of the day. And I always look wrecked because it took my make up with it. Bummer! The smell is so strong and it WILL burn your eyes. I'm tired of being an oil slick. Move on.,2

What a dissapointment",1.0,"Im not sure if it was a bad batch or this is how this product really is (first time buying and trying) but it started pilling. at first i thought maybe it was the eye cream ( different brand) i was using in addition to it, or the hyaluronic acid ( different brand) or the SPF (same brand) so i started using it separately and it was still pilling. I have a replacement coming so i will update after trying it and change my review then**updated 11/2:Received my replacement a few weeks ago and gave it a try... it is still pilling. Not as bad as the first one i bought and replaced, but still doing it. Don't buy this and find something else.",12

Wish I could return this",1.0,"I received it on May 30th and since I’ve been using it, I noticed that I’ve been breaking out in the areas that I concentrate it in the most. I’m not certain if this moisturizer is the main reason, but it’s mostly in my nose area, my chin and my cheeks. Some on my forehead, but not as much. I don’t usually have acne breakouts in this proportion. I find it unusual that I have this amount of acne this size near my cheeks after using this. Definitely be careful and avoid using if you notice you break out more often, it was a bit late for me though. My skin before using this is in the picture with the red striped shirt. My skin today is shown in the image with the pink shirt. At first I thought it was hydrating my skin but overall my skin doesn’t seem to be reacting well to it.

Definitely not for Sensitive Skin",1.0,I bought this product because it claims helps with rosacea & dryness. Once I put a small pea amount on my freshly clean face I immediately started to feel burning & itchiness. So I told myself maybe that because my skin is a bit too dry. So next day my face was like a tomato 🙄 😒  it worst than before now. Definitely don't recommend on sensitive Rosacea skin.,7

After watching the budget dermatologist talk about this moisturizer I decided to give it a try and I'M SO HAPPY I DID this is perfect for my skin! I have acne prone sensitive skin that can be really dry on my forehead and on my smile expression. This is godsend, it moisturizers so much and I hate oily and sticky stuff and this is just perfect, I can finally say I found the one for me because I was about to give up really 🙁 try this and if you don't like just return!------Update : after a few days using this moisturizer and loving it, I started breaking out really bad! It was the only thing I've changed in my skin care routine, and now I have 10+ pimples on my lovely face. It's SO FRUSTRATING to be me sometimes. I believe this was caused by the dimethicone in this product plus I have niacinamide sensitivity so maybe they were the ones causing my break outs. So unfortunate. I will go back to my vanicream moisturizer (I like it but it isn't the best for moisture! At least it won't break me out!) good luck for anyone else.",61

Corn starch = doughy texture",1.0,"The only thing I like about this product is that it is fragrance free. I don’t like the consistency which is somewhat waxy, and I definitely don’t appreciate that when it dries on the face , it starts rolling off into gooey dough- like little balls. And no, it is not exfoliated skin rolling off- it is the product.The biggest annoyance though is that the ingredients listed on the Amazon page are much different than the ingredients listed on the box . My box lists corn starch and squalene, but those aren’t suppose to be in there, and if they changed their ingredients , they need to update  and disclose that to potential customers. I believe it is the starch in this cream that makes it “ pill” up , as so many other reviewers have noted.I definitely can not recommend this skin care product . I would imagine that there are better face creams at my local supermarket!",25

I wish I read the Amazon negative reviews!!",1.0,"Unfortunately, I googled what the best moisturizer was for dry skin, and a couple of beauty blogs recommended it! Searched in Amazon of course and I didn’t bother reading the reviews since I saw how many stars and I thought it was pretty high. Well my mistake!! This, by far, was the crapiest, useless and to top it off, expensive lotion that when I rubbed my face, it became like little dried white pebbles all over my face!! I had to wash my face to remove the stupid lotion… exactly what a lot of the negative reviews described!! The lotion dried up and you will feel it off like crusts falling off once you rub your face! I was going to return it but sadly, I threw the packaging right away since I want to put it in my vanity area right away. Lesson learned, never throw away the original packaging, at least keep it for a week! Shame on whoever created this useless and expensive product ! La roche is not good at all! Stay away from that brand !!",22

Not for sensitive skin or rosacea",1.0,"I recently discovered I have rosacea. I also have senstive skin.  I really wanted to find a moisturizer that would help reduce the redness on my cheeks when it flares up.  I used this moisturizer for a few days.  After the first application, everything seemed ok, but I did feel a slight burning sensation. I thought it was because I had just washed my face and that my pores were still too open.  But by the third day of using this, my face became red and hot, often itchy too, after applying the lotion.  I developed at least 4 papules/pimples on my right cheekbone and forhead along with the discomfort and redness.  I do not have nor have I ever had acne prone skin.  I've never had pimples like this on my face ever and I'm pushing 50.  I've discontinued use and contacted my doctor.",9

Updated review from 3 to 1 star after I realized it pills  under makeup.",1.0,"I saw a bunch of you tube dermatologist raving about this moisturizer.  I don't know why.  The best thing about it is it does have ceramides, etc, is very gentle on sensitive skin, dries quickly and is non-greasy.  But it falls way short on the number one reason for a moisturizer...moisturization.  Left my skin still dry and crying out for a good,  deep moisturizer.  If you are young, with acne prone skin, this is probably a decent mositurizer for you.  But if you have dry skin or are older,  it's a fail.Update: at first I thought it must be my primer causing my foundation to pill up as I  was blending it out, so I stopped using the primer and it was still happening.  I stopped using this product and viola the pilling stopped.  Very weird considering how it was not very moisturizing.",7

Major Skin Breakouts",1.0,"I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to make sure I did this time. This moisturizer caused me a lot of breakouts and seriously irritated my skin. I get occasional flare ups from roseacea, nothing too serious. I generally don’t use anything to treat the condition, because most days it’s not a problem. I just keep a fairly simple skin care routine— moisturizer and basic nuetragena moisturizer plus Retin A at night and SPF daytime.In the past, I’ve used fancy, expensive stuff from cosmetics shops, etc, as well as more basic stuff. This was the worst thing I’ve ever used on my face, and I’m in my mid 40s, so that’s saying something.This moisturizer was a complete disaster for my skin. It caused major pimples and redness/irritation, even when used solo. (I alternate days for retin A.) As soon as I stopped using it, my skin cleared right up. I strongly recommend you skip this one altogether.",6

Nice consistency and hydrating but gave me a bumpy rash and caused itching",1.0,"I ordered this product after reading the great reviews because I have very dry sensitive skin. I was concerned about the pilling from the other reviews but found did not cause pilling for me due to the fact that I exfoliate my skin every other day. After using this product, though it was hydrating, it caused a slight itching sensation and caused me to develop bumps all over my face. I usually use Cleure products but wanted to try something new but will go back to using those as they do not cause an allergic reaction for me! I really wanted this to work but oh well. The product also arrived unsealed which is a bit of a red flag.My search for super hydrating, sensitive-skin friendly moisturizer continues......",6

Pills and leaves residue that looks like flakes everywhere",1.0,"I had high hopes! For some reason, I tried this 3 times, and each time, it left a million little pieces of pulled residue all over my face, eyelashes, and eyebrows that looked like a bunch of little flakes! I tried to wipe them off, but because they were all soft/gooey, they would just stick lower onto my face and then more of the moisturizer would roll up into more bits. It was hideous! Not a chance this could work under makeup. I just started retinol, so I was worried it was my skin peeling, but it wasn't peeling. It was the product peeling. I used my other moisturizers after rehashing my face each time and it never happened with them. Tried this again, the polling/residue bits happened immediately. A return, sadly. I'm bummed; everyone loves this product so I hoped it would work for me. Maybe mine was old or a bad batch? I dunno.",5

Awful!",1.0,I've heard so many good things about this brand and I see it in every dermatologist office so I thought I'd give it a try. Worst mistake ever. I developed a terrible rash everywhere I put it. It felt like I had sunburn. It dried out my skin and made it real red. The lotion pills a lot too. It seems like the entire LaRoche posay brand does this And I've tried all of their moisturizers. Even the ones that are supposed to be able to be used on babies. I can't believe this brand is endorsed by the American eczema society. Save your money on this one.,7

Pills Horribly! It’s a No!",1.0,"I’ve used the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer for several weeks. I really wanted to like it but pills horribly. I’m unsure why there are positive reviews. I’ve tried  making sure my face was freshly exfoliated, tried using the La Roche-Posay Serum first. Nope, nothing helped with the white flaky/pilling. I even tried using a teeny, tiny amount (thinking maybe I was applying too thickly), didn’t help.My advice, Don’t waste your money. I accidentally waited 10 days past the return window😩so I will throw it away. It even pills if you use on the backs of your hands.Not sure why all of the hype.

I just put it on like 2 hours ago, and parts of my face feels dry already. It’s disappointing since this is a supposed to be a double moisturizer. I wouldn’t buy it again.But that’s just me. It has a lot of good reviews. And this brand is dermatologist recommended. Try it for yourself I guess.Edit: still 1 star. But I was going to just go ahead and use it at night, but it’s having a slight burning sensation on my skin and my eyes. I don’t recommend this one at all. Was a waste of money for me. Their cleanser has a similar sensation. But it’s a wash off so the burning doesn’t last. I figured it was some sort of exfoliant. Was not expecting the same burn sensation from the moisturizer.",8

Needs more hydration...",1.0,"I’ve used this the past few nights. When used after serums which leave behind a slight wetness, I think this moisturizer is okay. But used on clean skin by itself, it dried up, balled up / pilled / got ash-like very quickly, and that’s at night, not even including the daytime concerns of face masks or sunscreens. So, unfortunately this won’t be a daytime “one and done” option for me before putting on a face mask to go to work. And unfortunately it also won’t be an option for me to use before sunscreens in the morning, especially not under face masks. The “pilling” would be an absolute nightmare in both cases. So, this product is just too restrictive as is, and I cannot recommend it for broad usage. Used at night however, following hydrating toners / serums, if never ever touched, for people who sleep on their backs only, it could be manageable for a touch of moisture, but I will not be repurchasing this. I’ll keep looking.",3

Also didn’t see a point in not covering my forehead and around my eyes anymore.2.Every time I got more than normal sun exposure I would notice I would break out with several pimples. This happened several times and I refused to believe it was this but after the 5th time in 3 months I accepted that it was.Pros:1.When I applied it under my makeup it didn’t get me oily.After 3 months I gave up and unfortunately will not use this anymore. La rosche posay products are great but this one isn’t. The face wash cleanser thankfully would remove the pimples that I got from the moisturizer in like 2 to 3 days.",24
