Moisturizer and plumps your skin",5,"I bought serum, moisturizer, and the pure vitamin C. I'm 73 yrs young and these products do what they say they'll do.

Believe the hype",5,"Okay, I bought this on a Prime day, immediately regretting my purchase. It arrived quickly and I tried it. The smell is quite perfumery…smells like my grandma. But OMFGoodness!!!??! It leaves my skin so dewy, bright, and glowing without glitter, shimmer or grease. My skin actually looks younger and it looks that way all day, not just while it dries! It layers nicely, no pulling or balling up when I later it over products or layer heavier moisturizer, sunscreen or foundation over it. It makes powder set without looking Cakey. I’ve actually stopped wearing foundation and just use a little bronzer about 30 minutes after I apply this. It sets and I look radiant and healthy all day.Do NOT hesitate to buy this!",90

Nice seller- product is water",5,"There was a Walmart version serum that was perfect but has been discontinued that was literally better.From the responses I thought it’d be so good and moisturizing but it’s really light and honestly me putting water on my face every 5 hrs works better. I’ve purchased from TikTok popular “canvas beauty’s body glaze” - and put it on my face that works so good for the face- doesn’t break my skin out, is moisturizing, and softens my texture. Also smells good.  Lol I use that instead of this product.",11

great product-dermatologist recommended",5,I ordered this item online after comparing pricing at one of the local drugstores. No one could match the Amazon price. My dermatologist gave me a sample of the hyaluronic acid and told me to use it over the retin A nightly. I have sensitive skin so my dermatologist wanted me to try the sample first but this is the brand she recommended. My skin feels so soft and appears to be even smoother after several weeks of use. I would definitely recommend it!,6

Use on my glam days",5,"I typically use the Ordinary hyaluronic serum and niacinamide together as a simple, affordable, fragrance free super combo. But days where I want to feel luxurious this is it!! The floral scent is a little strong, but it is so moisturizing and calming to my skin I do not need to follow up with any moisturizer! Leaves you very dewy if you like that. Will keep in rotation and purchase again for sure!",22

Great for sensitive and very dry skin!",5,"I never give reviews but I absolutely needed to for this product!!! I have been struggling for a while with a dry face. Whether it's been this pregnancy, the time of year it is, or a mix of both. My face had gotten so bad I couldn't put make-up on without it looking like I had dry flakes all over, just stuck on my face. I was peeling ever few days. All I had to do was run my fingers across my face and there was dry skin. I've tried other products, even a face washer with a brush. Nothing was working.  I ordered this product off a suggestion from other moms in a Facebook group. It was the best decision I've ever made for my face. I've been using this product along with the double repair face moisturizer for less than a week and have seen a huge difference already. The first couple of days my face finished peeling, lightly I may add, all the old dead skin. Now its smooth and shiny and just looks more alive than dull and dry. I still have some dry spots but nothing like before. I was actually able to put make-up on for the first time in weeks. Overall this product just makes me and my skin feel so much better and a little extra perk is it smells great too!",33

Love La Roche-Posay products!",5,"This serum is WONDERFUL. I am on my 2nd bottle now, I wanted to review after giving a full 30 days. My skin is combination, with a slightly oily T zone, then dry everywhere else. I use this  Hyaluronic Acid Serum every morning after cleansing and before moisturizing. My skin has seen such a difference, it looks hydrated, the oil is under control, looks refreshed and brightened. Love this product.",9

Deeply hydrated skin",5,"Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum has become an essential part of my skincare routine. This serum has truly impressed me with its remarkable benefits.  Firstly, the packaging is sleek and practical, ensuring the product remains fresh and easy to dispense. The serum itself has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, making it perfect for layering with other skincare products.  One of the standout features of this serum is its formulation. It contains pure hyaluronic acid, which is renowned for its ability to deeply hydrate the skin. Upon application, I immediately felt a surge of moisture that left my skin feeling plump and refreshed  Another noteworthy aspect of this serum is its compatibility with sensitive skin. As someone with sensitive skin. I experienced no irritation or adverse reactions while using this serum, which is a testament to its gentle yet effective formula.",34

Great addition for your skin care routine",5,"I couldn't resist jumping on the serum bandwagon when I saw my grandma rocking her youthful looks in her late 70s. I mean, seriously, she's out here looking like she's in her 60s! So, of course, I had to get my hands on this magical potion she swears by. We both have sensitive skin and let me tell you, this serum is like a gentle hug for our faces. It hydrates like a boss and plays nicely with all my other skincare products. It's like the ultimate team player in my beauty routine. My abuela and I highly recommend this serum for all the sensitive skin beauties out there.

Amazing - Extremely hydrating and soothing",5,"I think I have bought this 5 or 6 times now because it has been amazing. It soothes wounds such as pimples and it hydrated my skin like no other (make sure to apply on damp skin). It also soothes irritation, inflammation, rashes, and other skin problems. Even though it is pricy, it is worth it and is probably one of my key ingredients in my skincare. This does have a really nice fragrance to it but even with sensitive skin (which I have) it does not cause any irritation but if you do not like fragranced products, then you should keep an eye out for this then.",28

THE BEST SERUM EVER",5,"I haven't had the best experience wit hylaronic acid in my opinion. There will be ones that give me a reaction to my skin (rarely ever happens idk what it happened that one time), the formula will be too sticky or just the hylaronic acid routine never works because I hate the serum I get. Oh brother, let me tell you. I LOVE THIS SERUM. When I bought this serum, I didn't know what to think. I haven't had positive experiences with hylaronic acid in the past so I didn't know what to expect. Once I put this on my face I WAS INSTANTLY IN LOVE. The consistency is perfect, it's not super sticky but it's still hylaronic acid. It's hydrating, and gives a beautiful modest glow to your skin. I have repurchased this many times in the big bottle and I use this serum 2x a day (morning & night), everyday. I will forever love this serum and never change brands. Reccomending this to anyone and everyone. GO GET THIS NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT",30
