this product pills on your skin",2.0,"I ordered this product to try with my skin care routine. It had high ratings for a hyaluronic acid serum.  first of all, this is not a serum it is a cream. This was ok but I was expecting a wet silky serum and did not get that.  I have tried it a couple of times now thinking it would get better but it has not. After I put this on my face, I will apply my moisturizer. As I rub in my moisturizer I notice it starts to roll up and pill on my face so in reality I am wiping it off and not benefitting from this product at all. I will not be purchasing this again but I do encourage others to at least try it. You may have a better experience than I have.",2

Not good",2.0,"This feels great on the skin, but like everyone else has said it pills off your face. It makes it hard to apply your makeup. Definitely won't be using this after the bottle empties",0

Not good for sensitive skin",2.0,"I have extremely sensitive skin and have used  Cerave products for about 10 years after seeing a dermatologist who recommended this line.  I use Cerave's hydrating facial cleanser and the daily moisturizing lotion and have been problem free  ever since.  I figured I'd give this new stuff a try.  I immediately had itching and burning and had to remove it.  If you're super sensitive, I would try this with caution.",0

Feels nice initially, but pills under other products",2.0,"As many other reviews have noted, this product pills up when you layer another on top of it. I specifically wanted a light moisturizing serum to wear under sunblock and foundation, but despite the claims on the box, this product cannot be used that way. I could see keeping it to wear at night when I only use lotion, but I already have the CeraVe PM moisturizer for that purpose.",0

Poorly designed dispenser",2.0,"This isn’t a serum that you put on and let your face absorb before you use another serum, if you do that sort of 3-step thing. This is a cream. That I use before I put on cream because on its own it isn’t creamy enough. So that part doesn’t work for me. The dispenser ALWAYS has a little dried knot of product the next day which you just have to pitch, so it’s a waste. It was a 2-package deal. I’ll use it up but wouldn’t buy this product again.",0
