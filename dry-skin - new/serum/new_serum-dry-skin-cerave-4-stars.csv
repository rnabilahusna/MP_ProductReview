Nice serum!",4.0,This is soft and it is  absorbed into the skin without being sticky. It moisturizes dry skin and fine lines. It doesn’t work as well on deep wrinkles. Good price to try the product and good shipping time.,3

Good, but please stop raising the price.",4.0,"The serum itself is a good product.  It absorbs fast, is not too oily, and has no smell.  The problem is, when I bought this in 2022 it was $11 per bottle.  Then in 2023 it was $18.  Now, just within the past few months it went to $19.  In addition to the soft skin that results from this serum, I cannot help but also feel the smooth sensation of getting ripped off.  Why raise the price so high?  Anyway, just get the Amazon Basics version, it's just as good.  Maybe if enough people reject their pricing strategy they will change course.",6

I really like the product and the brand so I buy Cerave for almost all of my skin care! It really helped me with my acne and dry skin problems.

I think it is good for sensitive skin because after 3 days, I am not feeling irritation.I did have a problem dispensing the serum, but a search on Google helped. Make sure the lid is on, turn the serum on its top and tap a few times. Let it sit overnight, upside down and it will dispense. At least that is how it worked for me.

Really Helps!",4.0,"I was was at a point with my 70 year old skin where I didn't know what to do, or try. I'm not a smoker, but I've had problems with the cracks around my lips forever. Aging makes it worse. I looked at expensive retinol creams, read about how they can burn sensitive skin, and then red a comment from an MD stating that all that is really needed is a good lotion with hyaluronic acid and at least 2 ceramides. I was already using CeraVe products, so I looked at this one. It has really made a difference in the dry, scaly areas on my face, while not over moisturizing the the spots that okay. I can continue with the same skin care regimen, just adding that first layer of HA after washing, continue with my daytime moisture with SPF 30, and makeup. No cracked lip lines, and my face has never felt so soft and smooth.",10

The product itself goes onto my skin SUPER smoothly, and if it's my last step I have no issues. However, if I layer a moisturizer or sunscreen on top of it, the product pills and flakes off of my face. This may be an issue with how this product reacts with specifically CeraVe's AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion. Even when I try to rub it in and give it plenty of time to soak into my skin, as soon as I add moisturizer it's totally unbearable. (Night cream seems fine though?)",0

Very silky and feels great, but so small!",4.0,I love this moisturizer. It made my skin feel great the minute I put it on. This product was highly recommended by the dermatology community and that's why I bought it. I love how it feels. My only gripe is that it is a freaking small bottle. Like I could probably go thru this bottle in one week. I have no idea why CeraVe would develop a product like this in the tiniest bottle imaginable.,2
