Smooth and refreshing",4,"Decided to give this serum a try for my dry skin even though the price was very hesitant for me to purchased it. So far I like it and leaves my skin feel hydrated and plump, and does leave you with a little glow. It does have a smell to it but it's not too strong and does not linger around. After applying it on my face it does leave a sticky/tacky residue, but after apply the La Roche-Posay moisturizer it's gone.",0

Strong fragrance",4,This is a nice serum but it has very strong floral  fragrance that does not go away. If you don’t like strong floral fragrance on your face I would recommend not to get this one.. I like the serum but will it repurchase due to the smell.,9

Effective but dislike the dropper",4,Effective product but the dropper is too bulky and leads to either accidental overuse or product waste. Does not last as long as a 1 Oz bottle of serum should last. If the dropper changes I'd repurchase but not as it is.,0

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",4,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.,18

It's fine",4,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Fine serum: cloying fragrance.  Won't repurchase.",4,"I have rosacea related dryness, redness, and irritation and purchased the LRP Hyalu B5 serum knowing it had fragrance as the last ingredient.  I need a layer of moisture beneath the LRP Double Repair Moisturizer with SPF, but the LRP Baume B5 is too heavy for my skin in warmer weather.  This serum is currently filling that void and performs as expected with no additional irritation from the fragrance.I would not say this serum improves my rosacea's appearance, nor is it a moisturizing miracle.What is that fragrance? It reminds me of something from the 90's.  The scent is sweet and worst of all, cloying! It's bizarre for a skincare product IMO.If my migraines were not under control I would have returned this serum immediately.  I use a sulfur mask daily and apply this serum after.  The scent of sulfur is completely masked, and I am able to smell the serum hours after application.Not returning, but not repurchasing until a fragrance free version is available.***Update: That fragrance is the same as a Garnier Fructis fiber gum hair putty from the 90s.",33

Great for sensitive skin",4,"I really like it for my dry, sensitive skin. I definitely felt that it helped my skin feel softer and more hydrated, and it helped when I was experiencing moisture barrier issues. The only thing I would change is the scent. It’s not awful and I can overlook it because the product works great, but I really don’t care for it and I think being fragrance free or having a lighter fragrance would make this product accessible to more people.",11

Hydrated my dehydrated skin",4,"The package arrived with no damages and in great condition. It’s a bit pricey but it’s a safe go to choice for a serum if you want something that’s going to relieve a dehydrated face overnight. This serum has a good number of humectants (hydrating ingredients) such as glycerin, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid (in that order) so if you live a dryer climate I recommend investing in a humidifier to get the most out of this serum. The serum is mostly clear, with a thick-ish consistency. When Applied it leaves your face feeling a bit tacky so I recommend a light moisturizer to pair it with. Also It has perfumes and fragrance so if you have sensitive skin I would skip this product. Good luck.",10

Package not well protected",4,The product seems OK but my comment goes to the poor delivery quality.  They should send it in a box instead a plastic bag.

It makes my skin look really healthy",4,"I ordered this product after reading a lot of reviews. It plumped up my face, reduced my dry skin and tiny pimples.

Sticky residue if I use too much only ....",4,"Before I ordered this, I read the reviews on the stickiness of this La Roche-Posay Hyalu B5 Serum and hesitated—but, I was curious to try it so I did order it after all. I’m glad I did.It comes packaged in an aqua-colored bottle to keep light out as much as possible, and with the eye dropper separate to avoid leaking before it arrives to the consumer. The serum does look rather thick and sticky as you pull it up into the stopper.When I applied it to my face, I did see where other customer’s may have experienced a little sticky feeling, but for me, as soon as I smoothed it over my face (and a little goes a long way), it absorbed nicely into my skin. I have very little residue and very little stickiness, and what stickiness I did have is because I applied too much. I applied less the next time and had no residue or stickiness atop my skin.My skin feels soft. And, there is a light pleasing fragrance—I can’t put my finger on what it is but I like it a lot—it’s not exactly floral and has a spicy hint to it, which I like a lot. It doesn’t overpower and doesn’t stay for so long that it bothers me, but lingers just enough to make me happy.The price at just under $30 is reasonable for hyaluronic acid serums—you can pay whatever you want for face serums and creams, for they come in prices to quite low to very very expensive. I would pay this much for this B5 serum. The B’s in face creams and serums are reported to work well for call regeneration. Whether there is enough in this serum to do anything remarkable I can’t answer that, but over time it certainly should help my skin. If very dramatic results are wanted, one should really consider a prescription-strength product that an over-the-counter product may not be able to deliver. But with continued consistent use, the over-the-counter products can deliver nice results.When I evaluate a face cream, serum, moisturizer, etc, I consider how it makes me feel, how it feels smoothing on my face, does it irritate my skin, the cost of the product, and are the claims it makes at any level working at all.Using those guidelines with La Roche-Posay B5 serum:1) It makes me feel pampered. I like the ‘luxe’ feel of the serum.2) Smoothing it on, it feels great, and the scent is pleasing. My skin feels soft afterward.3) There is no irritation to my sensitive skin—no itching, redness, burning.4) The cost is very reasonable for a facial serum. It compares to many other over-the-counter products like L’oreal Or Vichy—two of my go-to skin-care product companies.5) The claims part of what it does to my skin is the gray area, but their claims don’t seem to be very unreasonable. Most all skin-care companies make these claims. Since I can’t really know what’s happening on a cellular level, I turn to 1-4 and if those make me happy, then I will try the product again.I’d purchase this when it’s all gone.",15

Great serum but scent is almost unnecessary",4,"I’ve been using this daily for over a month now and have noticed minor changes (this is a positive). I have fairly oily and sensitive skin.Pros:- lightweight and absorbs nicely without feeling pasty/stickyCons:- dropper is terrible, I just dip the dropper stick into the vial and take my fingers and rub the dropper stick and pat it onto my face- unnecessary scent, it fades pretty quickly but to get scent, it likely is using extra and unnecessary fillers",0

Expensive Moisturizer But Highly Concentrated",4,"This is very expensive for what it is - a moisturizer for dry skin. That said, it feels very soothing and the formula is apparently highly concentrated, so you don't need to use more than a drop or two each time (hence the eye dropper). My skin felt wonderfully smooth and well moisturized afterwards, but I could say this about a lot of other moisturizers. The main drawbacks is the price, the very strong fragrance (typical of high end products) and the fact there's no SPF in it, which limits its use to nighttime. Overall, it's a quality product to pamper yourself with, but I wish the price point was lower.",0

Good quality, trusted brand, and I noticed some positive difference.",4,"I am a huge fan of this brand. I started with their sunscreen...the best I have ever used...and have tried many other products with great results.This is a thickish clear serum. One big drop is enough to cover my face and neck. It needs to rest on your face after application for a minute to fully sink in before using any make-up. Other than that, it was easy and I had no bad reaction, a good thing since my skin can be sensitive.Did it plump up my skin? Yes, to some degree, but I have laugh lines and nothing short of surgery or Botox will erase them...options that are not on my menu. As for reducing fine lines, yes, it helped.",6

Very Moisturizing",4,"I use prescription products on my face, so I tried this serum on my neck and upper chest. It’s very thick and somewhat sticky, so a little goes a long way. It take a bit of time to be absorbed into the skin, but afterwards it seems like my skin is plumper and more moisturized. No amazing changes so far, but I do like it. I haven’t experienced any irritation and no breakouts, although the later isn’t likely in the areas that I apply it. I’d be reluctant to use this on my acne-prone face, however.",2

Nice, but",4,"This is a nice serum for the dry parts of my face, but it is indeed very sticky when it goes on. That is one big downer.The other is that for those who suffer acne long past youth, this serum does not help the oily parts of the face. It further clogs the pores and can add to the risk of breakouts.For dry skin, only, this stuff is great.But a drop is enough, and stay away from your ""acne prone"" areas.",3

Improves Dryness",4,"This comes in a little bottle with a dropper, and about one drop is all that is needed to spread over the skin of the face. It really does not take much, and using too much will leave a sticky feeling. The liquid is fairly thick as well. I used it for several weeks to see if there is an improvement in skin tone, and perhaps there is some, but it was not dramatic for me. It does make the skin soft and definitely less dry. I will continue to use this product to improve skin moisture.",0

Works well",4,"I got this for my wife, and she tested this out as part of her beauty regime and said that it worked well.

Works well",4,"This serum works really well. It’s not sticky and after a few days of use, my face felt noticeably softer and hydrated.  It didn’t irritate or cause my skin to redden or break out.  The only negative is the somewhat strong scent.  It bothered me initially but I’ve gotten used to it.  I think it will definitely turn off those who are fragrance-sensitive.",0

Seems to work",4,"This absorbs quickly into my skin and does seem to minimize wrinkles.  Unfortunately, it also seems to increase adult acne.  I may use a tiny bit on eyes and other smile lines, but I think I'll not use it on my entire face.  A tiny drop will do.",0

The formula is very thick and is absorbed very quickly.  I love the fragrance.",4,"It only takes a small amount to cover the whole face.  The formula is very thick and is absorbed very quickly.

works well",4,"The serum does give an instant result - the skins plumps up and the wrinkles look a bit smoother.

Alcohol Denatured",4,"First let me say, I love La Roche Posay. Many of their products have helped my skin so much, however I was bummed to see that the second ingredient in this is denatured alcohol!
