If you have sensitive skin - this burns!",2.0,"I have very dry, sensitive skin and this product BURNS. I went from using it by washing my face in the sink, but I use it in the shower mostly because my face is very wet and i can quickly rinse the product away after working it in. I‚Äôve been using it for about and month and I can honestly say I‚Äôve used other product that work much quicker in regards to moisture retention and reduced sensitivity. If anything, I think it‚Äôs made my skin MORE sensitive or susceptible to other products causing sensitivity?The texture is perfect since I don‚Äôt prefer cleansers to foam up, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to dry out my skin more than other cleansers and a little goes a long way. I use 1-2 pumps only but that burn and increased sensitivity is going to make this product a hard pass for me. such a bummer because I still have so much left üòí",2

Not a fan",2.0,"So, I‚Äôve never had bad acne really before. I tried this product due to all the raving on TikTok that I seen. While it may work for some, it doesn‚Äôt work for me. My face began to break out, (and I understand there‚Äôs a purging process at times with a new product), so I used it for about 2 months. Over time, my acne has just became worse. I went back to my original skincare products and it‚Äôs slowly going away again. Also, it didn‚Äôt really feel as if it was cleansing my face‚Ä¶ almost like applying a light lotion and washing it off, instead of a cleaning feeling.",3

Too gentle?",2.0,"I wanted to love this. I get really dry skin in the winter, so wanted something gentle to wash my skin. It‚Äôs awful at removing makeup. My face still feels dirty after cleaning it.

Not For Me - Burning and Stinging on Facial Skin",2.0,"I do not like this product and wouldn't recommend it if one has sensitive skin. I've used this for about 2 weeks now. Every time I would use this ""gentle"" face wash, the apple of my cheeks would sting and burn. It's left me with some type of skin irritation/rash on that area of my face. I stopped using it last night to see if the stinging/burning sensation would stop. Thankfully it has calmed down a bit. It still burns, of course. I anticipate it being a couple of weeks before its able to clear up.This product burned my face. And though everyone has different skin and skin needs, I personally wouldn't recommend this to those with sensitive, dry skin. I actually purchased this product specifically because it was made for sensitive, dry skin.The photo shows irritation I got from this product. Underneath my eyes, apple of my cheeks. That area was always burning and stinging whenever I used this. I also developed a spot of cystic acne (underneath the skin, painful bump).",150

Great product, poor packaging",2.0,"This cleanser has been my holy grail product for the past three years. It is non-irritating & gentle on the skin yet effectively removes light makeup & serves as a reliable 2nd cleanser for heavier makeup application. There is also no distinguishable fragrance.Major drawback: this is my first time purchasing this cleanser via Amazon and I think the packaging could definitely use some improvement. Unlike other items, this does not come wrapped with any protective material. This means that the pump is left exposed and vulnerable to breaking, which is what happened when I received my order. I luckily still had my old bottle so simply switched the pumps. For this reason, I will stick to purchasing this product from other retailers.",0

It‚Äôs alright",2.0,On the beginning it irritated my skin after washing and left a tingling sensation but i think over time i got used to it. it also only cleared up a little bit of my acne over time it didn‚Äôt fully affect it i think my skin got used to it and felt no effect.

I kept my face damp and applied excess moisturizer immediately after and it was the same. Sadly it's not a win for me.,0

Animal Testing",2.0,"I have been an avid fan of La Roche-Posay for many years, however this year I will not be going back, and nor will I pick up any items from this brand or their parent company, L'oreal, due to the fact that they pay for animal testing.  Consumers need to be aware of what they buy and what the company does behind closed doors before they put their products on shelves.In year 2019, the rise for cruelty free/vegan skincare products are highly sought after. With so many great options that do not test on animals for the same price, I cannot and will not support LRP. I will happily switch back once I see that ""vegan"" or ""cruelty-free"" stamp, but until then my money will go else where.",3

Not sure it did anything.",2.0,"I didn't care for this face wash.  I've tried other cleansers before that didn't lather but still left my skin clean.  This is not one of them.  No lather means it doesn't go very far.  I used it daily and my skin always felt grimy later.  If I scraped my fingernails down my neck in the shower after supposedly cleaning with this face wash, my nails were covered in sludge of oils and dead skin.  I've since switched back to my usual Jack Black Pure Clean face wash and finally feel clean again.  No sludge.  No grimy feeling. Just clean, clear skin.",2

Nothing special",2.0,This cleanser stated in description that it removes makeup. It removed some of my makeup but not all of it. It did not remove all traces of my eye makeup (which was not waterproof.) It does not remove long lasting lipstick. I had to use a separate makeup remover for my eyes after cleansing. It did not burn or irritate and there was no strong smell to it. The rating is because it did not deliver on what it described. It removed some makeup but I still had to cleanse twice and use eye make up remover. I would not purchase again.,0

Billed As Product for Sensitive Skin - Do Not Work for me",2.0,"Former Mary Kay user until they discontinued product. For years I found original product on various sights; eventually stopped due to price-gouging. The moisturizer worked well, but the product was not ""hydrating gentle cleanser"" as marketed for me.  Would say that each person is different, so it may work for you. I'm older woman who has been looking for MK replacements for years. Tried numerous products; many worked for a while then didn't resulting in small bumps or irritated skin or dark marks. I assume that the toner product was less effective.

I‚Äôve started breaking out on either side of my chin which I can‚Äôt solely blame on this cleanser but I‚Äôm not ruling it out either based on the time I started using the cleanser and the breakout. As most women know many things can cause breakouts. My combo skin may need something a little more aggressive than this cleanser.,4

Not a fan",2.0,I wouldn't repurchase this. This tends to actually burn my skin at times to the point of being a little scared to use it.

I bought this instead of my usual Cerave foaming wash (which never ever burns...
