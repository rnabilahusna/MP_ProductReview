Good Fragrance Free Cleanser",5.0,"This is a basic facial cleanser. Fragrance-free, simple ingredients list, and works as expected. This does not foam up like the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser*.To take off makeup, I double cleanse with KOSE Oil** and Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser. This is an effective combination but it is drying and I have to moisturize with Cerave Moisturizing  Cream afterwards.On days when I do not wear makeup, I use this cleanser.RECOMMENDATION: This is a luxury item, not a necessity. If you already have a cleanser, use that one up first and then consider buying this one. For makeup removal, I would not rely on this alone. I would double cleanse or at least wipe my face down with a make-up remover cloth or a face towel.* https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Foaming-Facial-Cleanser-Washing/dp/B01N1LL62W/ref=sr_1_2_pp?crid=HPP2NC6FE1LO&keywords=Cerave+foaming&qid=1704145567&rdc=1&sprefix=cerave+foamin%2Caps%2C93&sr=8-2** https://www.amazon.com/Beverly-Softymo-Speedy-Cleansing-7-77floz/dp/B0CGCM48SC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=7LZEC4FTKW97&keywords=KOSE+oil&qid=1704145753&sprefix=kose+oil%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-2",45

Great for dry, sensitive skin",5.0,"I had finally ran out of my 'usual' facial cleanser and decided I wanted to try something new. Among a few others, I chose this facial cleanser for some specific reasons. Number one: it's very gentle and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry after use. Number two: fair price, especially when compared to the multiple other cleansers available at all price points. Number three: I have a family member who used to work in a plastic surgeon's office and she said that the doctor absolutely loves products from this company, and he always had samples available which she of course tried for herself and loved.This cleanser is very creamy and does not lather (which is just fine - lather is not necessary to indicate a product is actually working or not). There is no detectable scent/fragrance. I apply it all over my face with my fingertips, then I use a Makeup Eraser type of cloth to go over my entire face and neck in a circular motion. Afterwards, my skin feels clean and soft and prepared for the rest of my skincare routine. I also got my boyfriend to start using it due to having rosacea and he finally got rid of his bar soap (yaaaayyy!). I can't say enough good things about this stuff, and I highly recommend it, especially if you have very sensitive skin, dryness, are post-procedural and need a gentle, effective cleanser. I give it ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Hope my review helped someone make a more informed decision about buying it or not.",70

My dermatologist gave me samples. All you need to know.",5.0,"I bought the larger bottle once my dermatologist provided samples ran out. I have a skin issue that closely resembles the butterfly pattern one gets from having lupus. I have been tested, I do not have lupus, but I do get scaly, peely, cracked oatmeal pattern skin around my mustache line, nose, and t-zone area. I have to use an every other day shampoo that keeps my skin in check, on my head and face. This moisturizing face wash really helps keep my face from drying out as much. Especially under my eyes and on my nose. It does not have any smell really. Its light and airy and will not suds up. If you have a skin issue and need something that won't irritate your skin but will help retain some moisture, this product is it. My dermatologist agrees. Enough so that he gives it away in samples. Or I wouldn't even know about it.Just remember. Everyone is different. What works for one, or even most, may not work for everyone. Try to remeber that when giving a review. Something can be 5 stars for most but not work for you. Not working for you doesnt mean it's a bad product. It's only a bad product if it is not as advertised. Be fair and desriptive when reviewing so others don't miss out on what may work for them.I hope you all find what you need for your skin.Cheers üçª",19

My favorite face wash! Great for sensitive skin!",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I‚Äôve been using this face wash for the past year and it‚Äôs done my skin WONDERS !! üò´ My skin tends to be kinda dry but slightly oily in my t zone and around my nostrils. I‚Äôm also prone to breakouts, and anything scented tends to make things worse. I could never find a skincare routine that fully worked for me and made the breakouts stop. I was putting in SO MUCH WORK for little results, and then I started using this stuff and LET ME TELL YOU- MY SKIN HAS NEVER LOOKED/FELT SO GOOD !! At first, I noticed I was still dealing with some blemishes and almost stopped using this stuff cause I thought it was the face wash‚Äôs fault but it turns out it‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt using it properly (oops). Make sure to use a wash cloth when washing your face! I was uneducated and didn‚Äôt realize that by not using a wash cloth, I was leaving some of the face wash trapped on my skin and it was clogging my pores and causing the pimples. So make sure to AT LEAST use a clean wash cloth when rinsing it off, if not for the entire wash and rinse process. Also, this doesn‚Äôt just apply to this face wash, it‚Äôs apparently common skincare knowledge that I was just unaware of (like I said, it wasn‚Äôt the face wash‚Äôs fault y‚Äôall)! I now am happy to say that I haven‚Äôt had a breakout or uneven skin in many months. I make sure to use it twice a day, morning and night, and for me personally I apply Paula‚Äôs choice pore reducing toner with a cotton pad afterwards (use toner while your skin is still wet!) and then usually vitamin c serum, a couple drops of jojoba oil, and some spf on top during the day. I dab off any extra oiliness with a paper towel (don‚Äôt rub the paper towel on your face it‚Äôs not good for your poor sensitive skin üò≠) At night I wash my face, use the toner, and then some jojoba oil, rosehip seed oil, or The Ordinary‚Äôs 1% retinol in squalane depending on what I feel my skin needs (also if you wanna start using a retinol serum, I highly recommend doing some research first so you know what you‚Äôre getting into/how often to use it!) overall, this stuff feels great on my face and isn‚Äôt too thick and it doesn‚Äôt leave any weird residue feeling like some face washes have in the past. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and balanced, no more dry or oily spots! I also love that the bottle is easy to take with me places because I travel a lot. It has a cool little c shaped clip that goes under the pump to keep it from leaking in your bag which is an honest lifesaver. The bottle is durable too/it‚Äôs not about to get crushed in my bag under all my stuff. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this face wash for anyone with sensitive skin!!",82

My holy grail product!",5.0,"The La Roche-Posay Toleriane Face Cleanser is IT for dry skin (especially at the price point).

Comparable to CeraVe",5.0,"I love this cleanser! I went down the rabbit hole that is La Roche-Posay, but it's a good thing! This is gentle,  and it leaves my skin soft & smooth. It's a gel/balm consistency & sans scent. I don't have sensitive skin, but I imagine that it would suit someone who does. It removes makeup really well, and it doesn't bother my eyes. 10+ üåü",5

Other cleansers that I tried at citric acid in them that did not work with my skin.This made my skin look and feel so much better after the first use (probably because of lack of PEG and SLS).I have been using this for a few weeks now and really like it.

Gentle cleanser for all skin types",5.0,I took a gamble on this product as I was deviating from my customary mens clinique products for over 20 years. I had been using the men's charcoal cleanser from that line ever since it came out. Still something was missing. I came across laroche products while doing some research and after the first usage I was sold.  It's been a good two weeks now and this will be my new go-to cleanser. It is gentle and very smooth. Non scented and doesn't lather up.  I used to have really oily skin as a younger man and would of loved to have this product too however I genuinely believe that this will be ideal for all skin types.  Overall 5 stars all across the board! Clinique has been good to me but switching over to this product for my main cleanser,4

Title: ‚ÄúA Game-Changer for My Skincare Routine!‚ÄùReview:I recently purchased this facial cleaner, and it has truly transformed my skincare routine. The gentle yet effective cleansing action leaves my skin feeling refreshed and revitalized. I usually go for a cleanser with a foam but this did the job of getting my skin clean. I wear makeup a lot so having a good cleanser is very important to me. I would say give this cleanser a try. It does the job!",0

I absolutely love this cleanser!",5.0,"I adore this cleanser. My skin feels so soft afterwards. I use a lot of active ingredients (like vitamin c, retinol, and acids) so my skin started flaking really bad which was surprising because I have oilier skin. Anyways I was reading somewhere that I should switch over to cream cleansers to help hydrate my skin. The idea of a cream cleanser felt kind of foreign because of my oily skin background but I still decided to try it out and am so happy I did. My skin feels nourished and is looking great. Above is a photo with no makeup (minus brow). I'm getting more comfortable in my skin",14

Luxurious texture & gentle",5.0,"I used to use only oils to clean my face but as I'm getting older (62), the oil started to become irritating so I tried a couple of cleaners. This is the one I will be sticking to. This cleanser is so easy on my skin that I'm amazed at how well it cleans it. The texture of this is really lux feeling. There is no foam - which bothered me a little bit at first. I actually started out using too much of the product because I thought I needed to. I have learned that it only takes less than a nickel-sized amount. That means the one bottle will last me a while. Other than how gentle this is, the other thing I love is that there is zero scent and zero irritation. I don't wear makeup but this does clean away all the sunscreen and moisturizers I wear throughout the day. I like that it is so non-drying that I don't have to rush to apply moisturizers after I use it. My skin is in love.By the way, like the other couple of LRP products I've tried, this one has a good list of ingredients and the expiry date is well-marked.",122

Works well",5.0,"I am used to scrubbing beads in my face wash.  This is very smooth with not scrubbing agents (sorry, can't think of a better word).  This actually worked better than I thought it would.  It almost feels like soap.  To see that this was working, I would wash my face with another face cleaner that I have to see if there is any dirt that comes off after using this cleaner.  Very happy to say that there was no left over dirt after using this.  I just rub it into my face for a minute and takes it all off.  Nice to have it at such a low price, too.",13

Super hydration!!! Highly recommend!!!",5.0,My two new fave face products in my everyday routine. This review is over 1 1/2 month since I‚Äôve started using them.Before I start stating my thoughts on this product I must start off by stating my skin type and concerns. I have very sensitive skin and most days it‚Äôs dry only when the place is extra humid then I get oily skin (which is not often bcz I don‚Äôt be in the sun.) btw these products has very little scent which is very good for ppl who has highly sensitive nose or migraines that get triggered by high scents like me.The face wash is so great it‚Äôs super gentle on the skin and when you wash it off it shows right away how hydrating n clean your face looks after. (My skin is so sensitive that when I used any other face wash for less than 2min it would burn n leave a red scar on my face especially around my nose n mouth area I would then have to apply aloe burn cream)The face moisture is definitely doing what it says super moisturising and light weight no greasy or too oily feel to the skin leaving your face looking glowing and hydrating. I already placed an order for my next bottle to come.,20

My Favorite Hydrating Cleanser",5.0,"I began purchasing this product a long time ago and have always returned to it despite trying out other cleansers from time to time.Some cleansers feel as though you are stripping the natural oils from the face.  This one is not like that ‚Äì it feels very moisturizing and gentle on the skin.  Also, some hydrating cleansers don't feel as if they are actually cleansing the skin.  This one feels both cleansing AND hydrating.Also:‚Ä¢  it doesn't break me out‚Ä¢  one bottle lasts a long time‚Ä¢  it's affordable compared to many other brands that unnecessarily charge an outrageous price.  I would rather pay a fair price for a simple cleanser and splurge on skin care products that offer more bang for their buck. Products that are geared for antiaging, brightening the complexion, firming products, and so forth.‚Ä¢  the ingredients are not harsh‚Ä¢  it is gentle on the eyes ‚Äì they never sting with this one!‚Ä¢ my skin feels soft and well-nourished after cleansing‚Ä¢ it's oil-free, sulfate-free, and paraben free‚Ä¢  it can easily be purchased here on Amazon or at the drugstore‚Ä¢ it has heath-promoting skincare ingredients, such as niacinamide and ceramidesI have turned many of my friends onto this cleanser as well.  They all love it and have made it their go-to. I also do not expect to steer away from this product anytime soon.** For reference, I am 50 years old with normal healthy skin.",37
