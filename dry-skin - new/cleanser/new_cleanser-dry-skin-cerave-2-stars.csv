There is no scent, but it also does not moisturize",2.0,"Was recommended this product due to its moisturizing capabilities, but even with a cold wash, my face is still dry after this. Im not even sure how much it cleans. In the future, I would have bought a smaller version of this to test before buying this larger bottle.",0

Did not have protective plastic to prevent opening, seemed used",2.0,All other create products ive purchased similar to this one had protective plastic around the top to help prevent it from being used without paying. This one came without the plastic around the cap and seemed like someone had used it already. It also had some stains on the front.,0

Contains PEG",2.0,"They put PEG in this. One of the many chemicals banned in the EU in products for a reason. Big chemical companies win here. Given CereVe’s reputation, I didn’t even think to check. I would have hoped this company would not add these chemicals. Lesson learned.",0

Ordered the wrong one",2.0,I accidentally ordered the wrong one ....I normally use the foaming cleanser. This one doesn't remove makeup well and made my face really dry just after a few uses. Seriously feels like I'm washing my face with thick lotion! Won't use this one again.,0

Not at all like the Cerave Cream to Foam Cleanser",2.0,"Love Cerave products, really unhappy with this.  I'd used the Cream-to-Foam Cleanser and loved it, and when it came time to reorder I went with this on a recommendation.  Mistake.  This was so drying, perhaps because of the hyaluronic acid?  I used it for about a week as part of my regular skin care routine, and my skin was flaky and irritated.  Too late to return so I'll be pitching it.  Too bad.",0

Used it for years, but as of 2022..",2.0,I had used both this product and the AM moisturizer for years.  At some point Cerave changed the formula for the moisturizer and I could no longer use it.  I think the formula for this may have changed as well because I have been experiencing eczema around my eyes on and off for a year.  I didn't use it for a few weeks as I dealt with healing my skin.  Used it two days on a row and I'm beginning to see redness again...Try before you buy.,3

Is this thing watered down?!",2.0,"A typical example of how good and heavy advertising makes a product look what it's actually not! This thing  doesn't clean good (yes, I now it's a foamless cleanser) ! It cleanse not better than your favorite cleanser watered down by at least half, with your face not feeling thoroughly cleansed, even still greasy after using it. You truly need to use A PALM-FULL of this each time to have a well cleansed face, which actually makes this thing extremely expensive per use! Don't waste your money for this advertising marvel!",0

ehhh",2.0,"out of all the cerave products this is my least favorite one. it doesn’t create any foam at all so you have to use a lot for the product to cover your entire face, even when washing ur face in circular motion it is only layering up the surface and not really doing much for your face. also, the texture is weird, try for yourself and you’ll see. TRY the “makeup removing” one, that one is 10/10",0

I don't get the hype",2.0,"How this cleanser gets such high reviews is beyond me. It might have good ingredients and not be drying for sensitive skin, but it also does not rinse off well and does not leave the skin clean at all.  I do have dry skin and thought I would try it, but honestly, it feels like I am washing with a moisturizer and not a cleanser.  Even dry skin needs to be completely cleansed!  I do a double cleanse(cleansing oil followed by a regular cleanser) and with this, I had to go in with micellar water afterwards to remove the make-up residue left behind, and there was quite a bit. I have never had to do that with other cleansers I have used, so it is not my technique.  If you don't wear any make-up and don't want a deep cleanse, this might be great, but there are far better cleansers out there for dry skin than this one.",3

Feels oily when using",2.0,"OK, lots of people love this cleaner, but I tried it for a couple days and I really don’t like it. 1.) it feels very oily to me when apply it in my face. I really dislike the feel of it on my skin, and 2.) my face doesn’t feel as clean and smooth when I use this vs just using any other type of facial cleanser.

No cover?",2.0,"Okay, it’s says it’s  cerave but when I got it- it came without the sign and it smelled unusual. It didn’t smell like the one I usually have. Guess I’ll see the resultsEdit:Im still not 100% sure this is a legitimate product but I know for a fact that it did work a little. Over the weeks, I switched from the foaming cleanser to this cleanser day by day. I've noticed that sometimes when my blackheads start to fade away, and I put this on the next day, the blackheads would start to appear again. Another flaw is that it didn't have the reserved sign at one of the sides of the product. It only said CeraVe when it was supposed to say CeraVe with an r on the top. Yes, it helped my skin just the TINIEST bit, I'm still not proud of this product since there are MANY flaws with it. This product only helped my skin get smoother, nothing else. I wouldn't even say smoother since it would dry my skin and after I put on moisterizer and it ""goes away"" then my skin would start to feel softer than before. I wouldn't recommend buying this product so if your debating on buying this, I wouldn't. You should check out a different brand that Hyram recommends.",0

Started off okay...",2.0,"I have suffered somewhat with acne since I was 13, and the problem has only gotten worse with time, so I am always on the look out for a new product in case my skin ""get's used"" to my current process. Normally I use a 10% BP wash, but I wanted to try something new. I decided to give this a try, and have been using it twice a day since I purchased it on January 13th. At first, I enjoyed the product. Felt okay putting it on while combining it with micro abrasion crystals (for one of the two washes), and washed off easily. However, as of writing this, I have noticed that my break out's have actually gotten worse. Normally I might get a pimple a week, but since using this, I am getting a new one almost every other day. One might question my diet, but I have altered it greatly over the years. I eat more greens, go to the gym three times a week, and have cut out as much sugar and trans fats as I can. While that has helped, it seems this wash has undone all of that work, and has given me the worst break out I've had since high school (right cheek is covered, under the lip has two or three, and the lips as one or two.)For some people, maybe it did a good job. But for me, it feels like a big step back.",33

My skin was doing just fine before I started using this cleanser -- and it immediately broke me out into painful cystic acne I hadn't had since high school! I was so sad and upset cuz it took me years to get my skin into good condition and only a month for me to ruin it because of this cleanser.Maybe it works for other people, but for me, it's a hard no.

Ugh",2.0,"I was hyped by the positive reviews so decided to give this product a try. It feels like a lotion, not like other cleansing foams, has a weird scent and muddy white color. I used it for 2 weeks. I have combination and sensitive skin which is obviously acne prone too. Instead of helping my problem, this lotion gave me blackheads and whiteheads in places i have never had them before. It is annoying. I stopped using it and changed to a better cleanser that works for my skin thankfully. This didn't work for me. Still can be used as body lotion I guess ....",0

Although I am a new fan of these amazing skin care products, I’m not sure of this particular purchase. This was so watered down it almost was like using water! I later purchased the foaming facial wash and.that item came exactly as I would expect! I’m going to compare to see if they were separate sellers and let Amazon know.

Buy The Foaming One!!!",2.0,Honestly this product just doesn’t do it for me. When washing my face with this it doesn’t feel like I’m actually cleansing my face. Really feels like I’m just smearing lotion on my face then getting it off and my skin has started to break out. I’ll try the Foaming Cleanser and hopefully that works.UPDATE: Tried the Walmart version of the Foaming Cleanser and I absolutely loved it it was only 3 dollars (Equate Foaming Facial Cleanser) instead of 12 for CeraVe and it’s amazing actually felt like it was cleaning and I’m assuming CeraVes version is probably the same so definitely get that instead of this hydrating one. But if you can try the Equate one as it’s a much better price and I even heard it’s better due to some ingredients.,52

I even tried using a scrubbing wash cloth with this wash (rather than my fingers as it recommends), but since there's no lather, it doesn't make any difference.

do",2.0,"While it is very moisturizing and rinses well, it does not remove the slightest amount of makeup, which makes you wonder how clean it makes your face. Secondly, I might get a pimple once or twice a month, if at all. However, after using this for a week, many pimples popped up on my chin/around my mouth. I discontinued it and the acne went away. Because I love CeraVe's other products, I tried again after three weeks. Same thing happened. Broke out around my chin. My skin is normal. I was disappointed, especially as it is not cheap and I have to throw away the entire bottle.",2

Didn't work well for me",2.0,"Unfortunately this product didn't work for me. My dermatologist recently told me I have rosacea and prescribed a topical for the cystic pimples it was causing. I asked if I could change my face wash from 10% benzoyl peroxide to something with less. I thought I would try this, because of all the great recommendation. I used this product and my face exploded with all kinds of different pimples. I thought that the change was what may have caused the break out so I kept using the product until gone. However the problem continues. So I will have to keep trying new things. Bummed because the price of this compared to my normal  product Humane Face wash is half the price.",80

Not impressed.",2.0,I have been using this for a while and I have to use it with a silicone face scrubber or it does nothing. I wear make up some days and it wouldn’t take it off on it’s own.

After using this my faces was burning all day! And the next morning I woke up with a few blemishes on my face. My skin is not that sensitive but, something they put inside this triggered my skin.
