GREAT for its purpose",4.0,"This cleanser is exactly as it's advertised which is why I gave it a higher rating. That being said I also want to note that I am not the biggest fan of it because it is a GENTLE cleanser and I should've thought hard on that before purchasing since I use oils and serums for my skincare. The gentle cleanser is not the best for getting things cleared and cleaned up on the first wash unless you have a lite amount of products on your face so I usually have to double cleanse with one brand then finish it with La Roche-Posay. However that's a good thing because it will not leave your skin feeling stripped and dry. Again, great gentle cleanser I just know moving forward I need something stronger and may do like an oil double cleanse type of routine",5

It’s okay.",4.0,"I think it all depends on your skin type. I have combination skin, and typically use the cleanser for it, but in the winter my skin leans more dry. I thought I’d give this a shot and see if it helps, but it’s not the right one for me. This is a really gentle cleanser, and I think it would be great for someone with dry skin!",0

Great for sensitive dry/normal skin",4.0,"While on retinol my skin was dryer than normal and this cleanser did a good job to alleviate that tight and dry sensation. The product is a creamy consistency and doesn't foam up so, if you have dry sensitive skin -- this product is for you! There isn't much of a scent, if I had to guess it smells like an unscented lotion. Though, now that I am no longer using retinol my skin went back to being combination (dry and oily). In the summer I found it hard to us this product, my skin felt congested and more oily. So, if you have very oily skin I wouldn't recommend.",6

moisturizes",4.0,This face cleanser also moisturizes my skin. My last face cleanser always left my skin feeling dry so I would have to moisture my face afterwards. With this one I don't. It doesn't have a scent. It is very smooth. It washes off easily. It removes all the makeup from my face. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I love it,6

Good for dry skin",4.0,"For reference I have dry/combo, sensitive, acne prone skin. I tend to use a lot of acne products which are always quite drying. This face wash is the only one I’ve come across that doesn’t leave my skin feeling overly tight after washing. If you have dry skin most washes will leave your skin feeling somewhat tight.(Pretty sure that’s normal) This product will still leave your skin feeling a tiny bit tight several minutes after washing but nothing like other products, your skin will still feel like it has some life to it. I doesn’t break me out but I haven’t specifically noticed a change in acne. (Think I have hormonal acne so not much can help) if you’re looking to pamper your skin and have a good moisturizer day/night you need to try this. Also I bought the large container and it is gigantic, great for the price.",12

Not too hydrating, not drying either.",4.0,"I have oily, acne prone skin that errs more on the dry side since I began using Tretinoin over a year ago. Regarding cleansers, I have to be careful not to use anything too stripping or I'll dry out and flake, but I also cant use anything too hydrating or I will (typically) break out. The only exception to this is winter time when the air is especially dry.Anywho, I switched to this from CeraVe's hydrating cleanser, which actually is hydrating. Problem is that one doesn't clean very well - especially if you wear alot of makeup, sunscreen, or occlusives. It's fine as a morning cleanser or if you spent the day laying around the house.This LRP cleanser is a good happy medium for me because it doesn't strip my skin or disrupt my barrier, also isn't too hydrating and doesn't leave a weird film on my face. My only issue is that it does sometimes irritate my eye area a little, which is strange because I'm not particularly sensitive, and the ingredients don't contain anything I haven't used before in other products.Overall, it's a pretty good product and I'll continue to use up the bottle that I have. I'm not yet sure if I will purchase it again, however, do to the occasional eye irritation.",12

only cleanser that works for me",4.0,"I have very sensitive skin and have tried like 15+ cleansers and this is the only one that has actually worked. I  barely get any acne with this cleanser but with all these so called (sensitive/moisturizing cleansers) that just completely strip my skin of any natural oils and just make my skin peel off and give me a ton of acne this one actually works. I love this cleanser so much that i bought one for my sister to try out because she has severe acne and she has said that she noticed a difference too. Main point is, this is a great cleanser it doesn't completely strip your face of its natural oils but enough to not make your skin really gross, its gentle and has worked for me and what seems to be a lot of other people too.",15

I really like it.",4.0,"I like that it is a light cleaner, but it has quick and effective cleaning properties without being too drying or harsh. It feels natural and doesn't leave the face too dry, perfect for dry skin. It isn't too expensive, but its a good brand, and I trust the ingredients so it is a little bit more than the cheaper,drying cleansers with worse ingredients. I like it and I like using natural products for everything health.It is moisturizing enough to use without a moisturizer when you want to let ur skin breathe and avoid clogged breakouts. It is light enough to use with a serum like retinol, or moisturizer when you need extra support. repurchasing new favorite.",10

Not super moisturizing",4.0,"I love this face wash, it has the cleanest ingredients that I have come across in a reasonably priced face wash.

Gentle Cleanser for Dry Skin, not Oily Skin",4.0,"I purchased this product after watching videos on Tik Tok recommending it to people with acne prone skin. Although the cleanser didn't break me out and is inarguably hydrating and quite gentle, I do not feel it did anything extremely remarkable for my skin. I still continued to have hormonal breakouts using this product even if it did cleanse my skin very well.

Feels promising.",4.0,"First day of use and wow I am all ready falling in love. I am 30 and have always been afraid of facial cleansers. When younger I have tried others claiming to be for sensitive skin and all of them fried my skin to hell. I had red,  swollen, extremely dry, painful skin from all of them even water was too much at times. And I decided to do research and find something that would work for me. Found out niacinamide when formulated correctly helps repair your skin. but do not use other products with niacinamide as it would be too much and can have the opposite effect. It didn't sting or burn and my skin is way less red in one use. Keep in mind a cleanser can only be so hydrating. so you do still need to have a good moisturizer for you without added niacinamide.",0

Great except for the niacinamide",4.0,"I'm starting to suspect I have a niacinamide sensitivity - I've tried a couple products with it and keep getting small hives on my face in regions where I don't usually get acne. I hoped that I could still use this face wash, because the texture is a nice milky gel, and leaves my face feeling clean but not dry. Unfortunately, I've noticed ""safe"" moisturizers were starting to sting, and I'm still seeing the occasional irritated bump. I think my skin dislikes even brief exposure to niacinamide. Oh well.",7

Good gentle cleanser but not for makeup removal",4.0,"This is a good cleanser, it’s filled with great ingredients, comes in a pretty decent size and is overall a good second step cleanser. It doesn’t leave your face tight after rinsing and it does feel lightly moisturizing. There isn’t a scent to this cleanser which I guess depends on personal preference; some people like to have fragrance in their products to each their own.Although I personally wouldn’t use this to remove my makeup for two reasons: 1.) for some reason this cleanser just burned my eye area. I’m constantly touching my eye area because I can’t see so I wear contacts religiously. I’m no stranger to my eyes being touched, rubbed, etc.2.) power of makeup removal. It’s good it’s not great but it’s pretty decent. I did a comparison with Cerave hydrating cleanser in terms of makeup removal. Yes this is better but not by much (again this probably depends what type, how much, dewy, matte makeup etc.)Overall a pretty great cleanser it lasted me a pretty long time and would recommend to those with sensitive skin just not around the eyes.My personal skin type:Normal to dry recently and My mother as well as my grandmother have had rosacea. I’m pretty sure I have it too I’m just too lazy to go to a derm. To confirm.",86

Started using this within this last week",4.0,"So far, the wash is great on my skin. Does not foam up or anything, but as stated, there is no soap in the ingredients. I don't know how much of a difference this has been for my face, as it has only been a week. I haven't had any issues with my face feeling dry after washing with this.",4

Gentle on sensitive skin but does it clean?",4.0,"Doesn't seem to break me out. Doesn't seem to irritate my rosacea but doesn't seem to help it either. It's not a soap so there is no lather. While it feels good on my face and after rinse, I'm not really sure it does a great job cleaning. After two weeks twice daily, sometimes leaving on for a minute or two, i seem to have more blackheads, especially around my chin  nose and now beginning on my cheeks. As someone else mentioned, it does little for getting makeup off but I use a mineral cleaner for that anyway. I'm saying it's okay but probably need to add a deep cleaner into the routine to flush out the pores better. Would I buy again? Maybe not.",0

it’s ok, could be better",4.0,"i like this for colder seasons where my skin feels dryer than normal, it definitely helps keep my moisture barrier up and prevents flaking, although it does get a little irritating if you let it sit on your skin for a bit so it can work into your skin",2

Not really sure",4.0,I really like this brand’s moisturizer so I decided to try their cleansers but I’m getting more breakouts since I started using this. Maybe I should try the one for oily skin instead. Also kinda makes my skin burn slightly when I’m using it in the shower. Does this happen to anyone else?,5

I don’t have a horrible time with acne so I can’t really attest to that, although I can say my skin hasn’t gotten any worse.  Mostly pleased with the easy makeup removal.",4

Great cleanser",4.0,"I love this cleanser. I received a sample of this to try from Walgreens. It has a creamy consistency to it, but it doesn't feel thick when you're washing your face with it. Easy to use, massage onto wet face, rinse off with water. I feel like I get all of the cleaner off when I splash my face. I have a shiny t-zone and I have tried many products to reduce the shine, this is the first product that has actually worked. I was shocked, it wasn't even for oily skin. It's also gentle on my skin, no redness anywhere. I have already bought and used my first bottle.",0

Awesome product for acneic oily skin",4.0,"I purchased this though I have acneic oily skin, because I had plans of starting tretinoin and was alerted to possible dryness. I usually double cleanse upon reaching home with a cleansing balm and a foaming facial wash. However, before heading to bed, I use this cleanser before adding my toner to damp skin.This claims to have ceramides, I'm guessing it's true since together with my tret, I have seen an improvement in my skin barrier with no dryness and dehydration. Though thick, this does not clog my skin nor does it irritate my face as it is frgrance free. Massaging it into my skin feels like rubbing a fluffy blanket unto my face. Money well spent. My only complaint was the outward curved base of my bottle, which means it was defective. However my produict inside is still sealed and protected so I did not ask for a refund.",0

Great for sensitive skin... takes 2 washed on its own",4.0,"I like to use this in the shower. But if you're looking to take off a whole day's worth of gunk, you need to double cleanse for this. it's too mild to use on it's own.",0

Pretty good so far",4.0,"I got a really bad chemical burn from a well known gentle cleanser (won’t say the name). To the point where I had to use aloe vera for a week. This was actually really gentle and hydrating though, haven’t seen any pealing or flaking. It’s a good size bottle. No real scent or a strong one that I could pick up. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the cap. Even though you get a lot of product, the hole is the size that should be on a thick lotion. And this is pretty liquidy so if you’re not careful, so much comes out. I tend to hold it upright and squeeze now. Don’t hold it upside down or you will lose like a handful of the product.",6

It's solid but...",4.0,"It isn't a very satisfying face wash when it comes to using it. It reminds me of Cetaphil, but with even less 'texture', I guess you could say. When I use it to wash my face, it is so discrete that it is hard to know if I really got my face good. Essentially, it doesn't lather, it can feel like water in a way. BUT that doesn't take away from the fact it is a good product. Takes off my makeup pretty good compared to other washes, no breakouts, skin feels clean afterward. I just wish it was like the blue face wash they have for oily/normal skin. Sadly, my skin leans drier, so this is a better product for me. A small amount of scent would be nice too, but I know scents can be irritable to the skin, so I won't fight that point hard.",0

Ultra sensitive skin? No problem.",4.0,Keeping in mind La Roche-Posay is a French drugstore brand & adjusting expectations appropriately I’d rate this product a 4 out of 5.The Pros:The ingredient list is fantastic for the under $20 price point.The cleanser is gentle & doesn’t strip skin barrier. (Will not remove makeup)It’s a milk cleanser that’s safe for skin with acne &/or Rosacea. (No foam)Easily rinses off skin without leaving behind a residue. (Rinses similarly to a gel cleanser)No fragranceNo soapThe Cons:Not anymore hydrating than other cleanser by this brand. I’d suggest you depend on your moisturizer or face oil for that.Be sure to review the ingredient list before use some people may be allergic to the same ingredients that make this a winner. Ex my s/o used this face wash bc it was conveniently located in the shower & had a slight reaction itchy skin to the 2nd ingredient listed which coincidentally is one of 3 that benefits my skin.I think this would work best for those of us who enjoy the Glossier Milky Jelly,16

Simple Face Wash",4.0,"I have dry acne skin and Ive been using this product for about 2 months. I find that it is a simple face. It has no scent, has a milky like texture, and isn't drying. It hasn't made my acne worse and I usually use it as my second cleanse (not as a first cleanse to remove makeup). I don't think this is anything revolutionary but if your looking for a simple face wash with a decent amount this is a good option.Personally if you have dry skin i recommend the Cervae Hydrating Face Wash over this but still not bad",0
