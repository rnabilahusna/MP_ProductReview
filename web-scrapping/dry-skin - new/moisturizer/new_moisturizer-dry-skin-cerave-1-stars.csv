Both bottles would not release the pump",1,"Called the 800 number for this product because the pumps would not release on both bottles I purchased.  They said to hit the top of pump with a hard object.  it finally worked, but pump is still not easy to use.Would not buey this again.

Now I won‚Äôt ever take advice from strangers.üò≠",1,"Took advice from tiktok, and decided to give the blue and (green version) combo a chance. It didn‚Äôt work and gave me horrible pimples, all over my face. I didn‚Äôt have that much pimples to begin with. I still used it for about 3 months straight, just in case it worked. BUT NOW MY FACE IS COVERED IN PIMPLES. (By the way, I threw it in the trash)",2

This product is great, but the package is terrible.",1,"I like the product, but when I first used the pump to get lotion out of the packaging, the pump broke! I had to screw off the cap with the broken pump, then I shook some lotion out of the container to apply. What a hassle (I bought the pump to make access easier).I wrote to the company telling them about the problem. They asked a bunch of questions (what is the exact product, when did I buy it, where did I buy it, how much did I pay for it), and after answering every question, their reply was basically ‚Äúsorry, there‚Äôs nothing we can do.‚Äù!I became very disappointed with the company even though I liked their product. I just wish their customer service would have been as good as their product (minus the defective packaging).",7

This product is straight up bad",1,I am the kind of person who reads a lot of reviews and does her research before buying a product. However watching so many dermatologists vouching for this moisturizer I caved in. I just read some reviewa and most were positive. It didn't work for me.there were other products I was using along with it so I had to do a lot of permutations to weed out the bad ones. I also use two apps now that score products. I highly recommend yuca and skin bliss to you. I am not going to talk more about the apps. They however showed me how some of these endorsed products did not work for someone with my complex skin type and then further showed me how terrible they are to begin with.do what you must with this info. It has nothing to do with the seller btw. The product is just bad.lots of ingredients that are bad. You will be so shocked to find how many products we use daily are affecting us int he long run and am not just saying breakouts and what not but cancer causing.,18

(Best lotion I‚Äôve ever used!) WAS until L‚ÄôOreal changed the formula...",1,"Already reviewed, but I‚Äôll add to: this is a completely amazing lotion. I like it so much I did subscribe and save. This has given me baby-soft, silky skin, all over. Superb stuff!!An UPDATE and WARNING:Apparently CeraVe was bought by L‚ÄôOreal, and as with all good things ruined by conglomerates, the formula has been changed. The last big bottle I got through Amazon S&S was the old formula I loved so much. I bought a tiny bottle for my bag, and noticed it wasn‚Äôt the same, it‚Äôs more of a gel now and doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well. Then I looked at the ingredient labels! Some reshuffling, which means some stuff that was already there was increased, some stuff was decreased (namely, the ceramides), and some garbage was added, which makes me fairly angry. WHY do these huge companies wreck good things for the customers who love a product? So...through no fault of Amazon, I cancelled my S&S and will start the long and expensive slog of trying to find a lotion that works.",44

Normally there is no  odor/scent to this lotion. But this time it smelled slightly fishy, like something rotting. It was disgusting, and it smelled strongest after you put it on your skin.

First Time CeraVe User",1,"I decided to transition to using the CeraVe products because they‚Äôre all so highly rated. This lotion was the first product I bought and I‚Äôve used it twice. Both times, all areas where I rubbed this stuff on after showering have just starting itching. BAD. Like I‚Äôm being bitten by fire ants. I‚Äôve applied a second layer to try and tame it with no luck, maybe even made it worse. Guess I won‚Äôt be buying anymore and will be returning this.",4

Smells like expired makeup foundation",1,"I wish i believed the lowly rated reviews..I don't know about the fishy smell that they are talking about..but to me, this smells like expired makeup foundation or lipstick.. or something rotten.. and it stays on your face for awhile after using, and im disappointed that i bought this and used this.I will stick with my usual Cetaphil face & body moisturizer.  :/",0

Not for me",1,"I purchased this lotion after reading rave reviews and being pleased with the price. Unfortunately, this lotion doesn't work for my skin. I have pretty average skin - not oily and not dry. It isn't flawless, but I don't have any major issues either. I had been using Cetaphil face cream and wanted to try something new. I paired this with the foaming facial cleanser. I stopped using the cleanser after only a day or two because I immediately noticed my skin was parched after using it. Wanting to see if this lotion would work, I began using my VaniCream facial bar soap again and this lotion at night. (I use Eucerin SPF 30 face lotion during the day). After 2+ weeks, I'm not impressed. My face is constantly breaking out (plus taking extremely long to heal) and he skin on my nose is super dry. Since everyone's skin is so different, I'm sure this works wonders for others. Unfortunately, not for me.",4

Dirty, scratched up bottle",1,The lotion is ok. A little goes a long way. Don‚Äôt use too much because it does feel a bit heavy and greasy and I hate that this arrived all scratched up and very dirty. This is after I washed it it looks disgusting and still does. It‚Äôs like they left it on the floor and just handed it to me.,5

DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!",1,"This is my favorite moisturizer, and I think I've purchased it twice before on Amazon (with no issues).  This time around, however, the moisturizer Amazon sent me was SPOILED- it literally smells like FISH OIL!!!!! Sick! I'm not sure if I just received a defective moisturizer or if maybe the composition of the moisturizer changed while on its way to me.  I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning the product, so it was a complete waste of money!!!! Thanks for basically just taking my money and running, Amazon.  Never again.",616

Lipid-like maybe? I‚Äôm not sure if it sat too long somewhere, got too hot or too cold in transit or the warehouse or what but it‚Äôs pretty fragrant and a little off-putting, and I‚Äôm not the only one who could smell it.",2

BEWARE--- Contains PARABENS",1,"Parabens have been known to be ""endocrine disrupters"" for several years now.  Parabens seep through the skin, into your system, and can harm metabolic and developmental processes, especially in the young.,  They are suspected contributers to chronic diseases.  Many companies that manufacture products we use for our bodies-- shampoos, creams, lotions-- have banned the use of Parabens in their products, and proudly advertise that they do that.  I did not realize, unfortunately, that this company still use PARABENS.  BAD for your health!  It is cheaper for companies to use this than other types of fillers and 'preservatives'.  Your potential bad health is the trade-off.",6

Two weeks of hot itching. It was so bad one night I had a dream that I was getting attack by wasps again on my ankles but it was the rash from the moisturizer.",7
