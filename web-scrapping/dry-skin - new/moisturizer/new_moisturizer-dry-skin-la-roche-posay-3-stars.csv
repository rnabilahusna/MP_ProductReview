Nice moisturizing cream, but ....",3.0,"I was so hopeful about this cream. I'd read that it was a good cream for people with acne, which is why I bought it (along with the fact that it has SPF in it). Unfortunately, this cream actually worsened my acne. Not super bad, but enough that I'm going back to my old moisturizing facial cream.On a positive note, I don't recall any scent to the cream, it was very gentle on my sensitive skin and only took a pea-sized amount to cover my entire face & neck.",0

Peels off my face",3.0,"I want to love this because it is thick and feels great to apply, but within a few hours of putting it on it peels off of my face. Has anyone else had this issue? At first I thought it was dead skin exfoliating off but that isn’t it, it’s like the lotion leaves a superficial layer that then rubs off",0

Pilling",3.0,I love the way this hydrates and moisturizes my face! It feels great going on and I thought it would be a really good moisturizer for day time use during the winter months. Unfortunately everytime I use this moisturizer it pills up on my face. So now I only use it when I know I'm staying home and won't be out in public.,0

It’s okay",3.0,"The first time I used this, I had a travel sized one from ulta and I loved it. It made me face so soft and clear. But then I ordered it again on here and it’s like peeling off my face? Not sure why, but if you put make up over it, that peels too",0

Irritated my face",3.0,This product felt great until the more I used it the more my face became irritated. My face developed an itchy rash. I don’t have sensitive skin so this was so surprising and disappointing.I found it moisturizing and would have loved to be able to continue using.,0

Not a huge fan",3.0,"This one feels nice after application, but when I apply my IT Cosmetics CC Cream over it, it basically rolls up into little balls and falls off of my face. Like if my skin was peeling after a burn (but without the burn). I've switched to wearing it only at night and that seems to help. But I will never wear it as a daytime moisturizer, and I won't buy it again.",0

Smooth, not tacky",3.0,"Glides on beautifully, absorbs easily, does not feel greasy. I'm 52 and live in Utah where we have the dry, desert heat of summer and the drying heat of indoor heaters during the winter. My skin gets super dry.The issue, for me, are clogged pores that I did not have before using this. I have had two largish blemishes develop while everything else seems to be enlarged pores, developing blackheads and some whiteheads. I've given this product a few weeks to see if the issue is my skin simply adjusting to a new product, and I'll continue to give it a few more, but I didn't have this issue with a product I've used for over 20 years that I've had difficulty finding in store or online. I've also noticed that my face always eems to be slightly red and splotchy in places, kind of like a blush.Overall, this product is one I REALLY want to like and continue using, but only time will tell if the enlarged and clogged pores are a result of the product or my skin adjusting.",13

Not as good as reviews promisex",3.0,"I’m 34 and my skin is dry, sensitive, and the pores are a little too obvious for my liking. It doesn’t break me out, but it isn’t the best for dry skin. If you live in a mild climate without harsh water it might be fine but it doesn’t sink into my skin, just sits on top and gets my hair super greasy, which is really obnoxious.",0

Still good, but I think the formulation changed.",3.0,"I really love this as a face moisturizer and have been using for 2+ years.  This particular batch felt much heavier and even a little greasy, not the same as what I've used in the past.  It's exactly the same brand/type, so not sure what changed, but I hope they change it back.",4

Gentle but not good for dry skin",3.0,"I ordered the face wash and moisturizer combo to try while my nose area is recovering from perioral dermatitis, opting for some gentler products. I have combination skin which is currently pretty dry as winter sets in, and the moisturizer just doesn't cut it. The cleanser is nice and gentle but I need to use an oil cleanser beforehand to get my makeup off (and I only wear a thin skin tint, nothing major). Additionally, the pores on my nose are newly clogged after switching to these products. After a week of using these my skin is dry and flaky in some areas, so unfortunately they're getting shelved - however, I think they'll be good to use after my chemical peels. I think this brand makes quality products but these weren't the best for my skin type, but may work better for those who do not have dry skin.",0

Pills with anything else",3.0,I really wanted to love this moisturizer mainly for day use as it’s pretty light but my god.This can only be used by itself. I dropped down to only using a hyaluronic acid serum plus this and it still pilled! Insanely irritating. I can only use it by itself which is pretty useless,3

Whiteheads :(",3.0,This is a fantastic moisturizer and really does enhance  skin wuality (possibly because of the dimethicone which gives the effect of a primer by blurring the skin) but it gives me whiteheads the morning after applying :( tiny whiteheads so I will keep looking for a good moisturizer,0

I loved this product- not sure if I got a bad/contaminated item",3.0,I love this product overall.  But my recent order smelled really strange.  It's generally pretty unscented with maybe a light smell of SPF.  I can't explain it but it smelled a little like cat liter. I tried really hard to get past it but everytime I put it on my face it freaked me out.,0

Wanted to love it",3.0,"The pilling was too much for me.  It didn't pill with every use, and I couldn't figure out why.  I've tried testing it with different face washes and serums, and I can't get the pilling to stop.  Sometimes I didn't notice the pilling, but I wonder if it came off onto my pillow at night.",2

Not sure if this is really authentic LaRoche",3.0,"So, Ive been using this for 3 months. I've had the pilling and it doesn't really seem like it moisturizes much. I will completely exfoliate and use my Pixi glycolic acid peels and then use this moisturizer. So the whole exfoliate well before applying doesn't even work. As far as scent there isn't one, which is good. It doesn't feel like lotion more like thick water. It also doesn't irritate my overly sensitive skin.Here is where the I don't think it's real comes in.A week ago my husband placed a pick up order for Walgreens. They placed some samples in the bag and he came home with them. One of the samples was this product.I grabbed it and said thanks. The next day I forgot to put my moisturizer on upstairs. So I grabbed the little sample on the table (feeling lazy and didn't want to climb a flight of stairs) and applied it in the downstairs half bath. I noticed right away that the consistency wasn't the same. The sample was more creamy. The more I put it on the more I was like wait, huh. So I ran upstairs and grabbed my big bottle.I pulled the cap off and told my husband they don't smell the same. My bottle from Amazon had a slightly underlying fragrance smell, nothing strong just a minute amount. The sample did not. My Amazon bottle pills almost constantly. The Walgreens sample did not...AT ALL!!! The Amazon one had a watery feel. The sample one was creamy and went on nicely and kept my face moisturized all day. The Amazon one I was reapplying multiple times a day.My husband asked me where I got the big bottle and I stated Amazon. He said maybe it's not right or it's old stock. Whichever it is I prefer the sample and will be getting it from Walgreens since it's the same price as here.",29

A little heavier than I was expecting & stings your eyes",3.0,"I have fair, combination skin and was looking for a 2 in 1 so I didn't have to buy two products and I could save a step in the morning. This moisturizer is a bit heavier than I was hoping for. It would probably be great for dry skin or in the winter. A little goes a long way, like a dime/nickle size for your face would be plenty. When I put it on I thought it would dry down, but it pretty much stayed moderately shiny. It doesn't absorb very much. It doesn't make me a total greaseball but with my already combination skin, I don't need any extra shine. I'm hoping it will do better in the fall/winter when my skin gets drier. It does sting your eyes too, so be careful. It took me a couple times to realize what it was because I didn't realize I was getting it too close to the corner of my eye.",5

Dry",3.0,"So far so amazing! All these years I've been using moisturizer for oily skin. Decided to try something new as my last moisturizer was not comfortable on my skin.This immediately felt soothing to my skin, no stinging, no redness, my face so far has stayed matte after application which is HUGE. First time in my skin conscious life I haven't had an oily gross face after about an hour in the morning.I don't love the bottle, the cap is a little difficult to open and I have a hard time getting a controlled amount of product out.*****Update, my face has been consistently super dry by mid day, huge flakey dry patches. So bummed. Idk why this would be so drying. My face feels really tight and uncomfortable after about an hour like it needs a good moisturizer.So bummed. I love how matte is makes me but can't do the dryness.",2

Perfect for oily, sensitive types and damaged skin barrier BUT pills if you don't know how to use it",3.0,"Don't get me wrong: it'll never break you out, it'll repair your skin barrier, and fade hyperpigmentation to even out your skin tone but it barely moisturizes since I have extremely dry skin and it pills a lot (creates crumbs on your face). You need to apply it on damp skin and rub it in extremely well, or apply it right after something wet like a serum or aloe vera in order for it to not pill. You could also just use it as a dedicated nighttime moisturizer if you don't want to risk someone seeing you pill at all.It'd be perfect for someone with an oily, sensitive skin type and they would not have much issue like I did. Where you live also depends because in tropical humid climates like Singapore, Mexico, or the Philippines, it absorbed into my skin easily and never pilled but the second I moved to a cold, dry climate in California, it pilled like crazy and didn't moisturize enough.If La Roche Posay changed the formulation to make it absorb better and never pill (or maybe added more moisture with hyaluronic acid/panthenol), this would probably be the best moisturizer on the market.",23

Good, but not for the anxious",3.0,"If you, like myself, suffer from anxiety and have a bad habit of skin picking, you probably shouldn't use this. I almost immediately began a new bad habit of rubbing my skin to the point of bruising because the moisturizer has a subtle grittiness to it that makes it addicting to rub off of my skin into little nubbins, leaving this residue all over my clothes and floor. It's like putting glue on your hands back in kindergarten and rubbing it off for fun except it's anxiety and it leaves you with very irritated skin. So yeah, not a good moisturizer for the anxiety-ridden, but otherwise not bad!",0

Not for hyper sensitive skin",3.0,"It is fragrance free. It is moisturizing. It will work for most. I have hyper sensitive skin, atypical, rosacea, and allergies. Plus I use a retinol product to keep everything under control which makes me more sensitive. So even some products that are usually ok for most, this wasn’t for me. Made my skin itch and broke me out. I have been trying to find a less expensive moisturizer than the one I have been using that is 110.00 for 1.7 oz. Done trying. I give up. Chanel makes a 10 ingredient moisturizer for sensitive skin and it is good. La Solution 10 if anyone suffers from extreme sensitivity.",4

Bad for my sensitive skin",3.0,"I've bought this product twice. Once for my SO and once for me. My SO has acne prone oily skin that is not sensitive at all and this product made his face very soft and cleared his complexion a bit. No acne flareups either. He loves it. I have somewhat sensitive skin that is prone to redness and hormonal acne. The second I put this lotion on my face it started burning intensely. Everywhere it touched. It felt like one of those face washes with salicylic acid that I used as a preteen. My skin still burns even after washing it off. Disappointing since their website said it would be good for sensitive skin. I've also used their cream cleanser and sunscreen and neither irritated my skin, so I hadn't really expected this to. Oh well. At least I have someone to give this to.",6

I know the pilling comes from this product because I've used it without retinol and have had the same pilling issue, too. Aside from this, it's a wonderful product!
