Superior Hydration at a Higher Price",4,"Though a bit pricier than other brands, CeraVe's Daily Moisturizing Lotion is worth every penny. It's a standout for dry skin, with hyaluronic acid and ceramides that deeply hydrate and nourish. Fragrance-free and non-greasy, it's been a real upgrade for my skincare routine.",4

Lightweight and long lasting",4,"This is a great moisturizer for someone that wants a really simple routine. It’s not irritating at all and scent-free. I have sensitive and oily skin and this doesn’t make it worse or interfere in any way. However, the price is what I’m not ecstatic about. It’s gotten more and more expensive over the years, so I might possibly consider looking for a new alternative if it keeps increasing in price. For now, it is and has been my most reliable option. A little goes a long way when applying as well!",7

Effective",4,"Senior here with thinning, itchy, allergy/dermatitis prone skin.  After a month of using Cera Ve Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin I’ve had no major itchy skin episodes.  The product does a relatively good job of retaining moisture in the skin.  The formula is easily spread and contains no discernible fragrance.  Used in combination with a small amount of Cera Ve’s Itch Relief Oil Cream it adequately relieves localized itchy skin flareups.  Like most of the brand’s eczema and itch relief products, it's best absorbed on damp skin immediately following bath or shower, otherwise it tends to feels like it’s just sitting on the surface of the skin.  I recommend this product to help lock in moisture to relieve dry, itchy skin.",12

CeraVe Lotion is Great!  Delivery Packaing is a Problem",4,"I love this lotion!  It's immediately moisturizing and not sticky!!!  My two favorite things about lotions.  I give 5 stars for the product.  The lack of securing the screw top so it doesn't unscrew during shipping is a problem.  There is a clip that prevents the pump from depressing, but the screw top came unscrewed and dumped lotion all over the shipment's contents.",0

Good for summer, too watery for winter",4,"The only thing I love more than a good moisturizer is a good deal so when I found this cheap but well reviewed lotion I had to buy it. Unfortunately, this lotion didn’t totally live up to my expectations. I have a generally normal skin type and use lotion every day after a shower. This stuff works well if you live in a humid climate and it’s hot enough out for the relative humidity to actually keep moisture in your skin. Unfortunately that isn’t everyone all the time always. I think that this lotion would work well in tandem with another heavier lotion to use during the winter or during times of dry skin. I personally think the cream version of this lotion is great. It is thick enough to not spill everywhere but goes on quickly. I probably won’t buy this lotion again.",0

Major improvement from Trader Joe’s moisturizer",4,"I really liked this product. I’m a male and struggle finding a neutral smelling moisturizer that works. At first it does have somewhat of a medicinal smell but over time it fades away. The texture/consistency is not too oily or rich, it’s just right. I use it for my face and body and am happy with results. I was using the Trader Joe’s brand prior, and after a few hours it would wear off and then my skin would dry up. Happy so far with results",2

Worked fine but have switched brands",4,"My dermatologist recommend this brand and I used it for a long time for keeping down minor psoriasis, which it could do for two or three weeks before I had to use medication again. It also worked great on dry, bumpy arms. However, at one point I couldn't find it locally and ordered it online. While waiting, I switched to Eucerin Advanced Repair and that has been amazing. I no longer need to use my medication to keep down the psoriasis flares at all, going on a few months now. So if using this for psoriasis, you might consider trying the other brand and see if it works for you.Also, I would not recommend using CeraVe on the face if you have sensitive skin! But it does work great on arms and legs.",0

Good but maybe I need a more moisturizing lotion, this is too watery.",4,"Not going to lie I had high expectations for this, I've seen it dermatologist recommendations all over the place for years. But when I opened it up and tried it one day after showering, which is when my skin is the dryest, I felt like it wasn't as moisturizing as my previous lotion. In fact I felt like it had a very watery base. So my recommendation is get it if you have normal to oily skin because I did find that the next day my face was less oily than normal. But if you have really dry skin, this particular one isn't the one for you.",0

I wanted something scent free for him but I end up using it more than him.  While it is probably technically scent free, it does have a slight smell which I find off-putting.

A little thinner consistency",4,"I am a huge fan of this brand because it does not irritate my sensitive skin. However, I didn't realize this would be so thin.

Light weight and hydrating but not for extremely dry/flaky skin.",4,"I have mild Ichthyosis and am trying new creams. It was hydrating and did not irritate my skin but I still have flakes after using it twice daily on my entire body for two weeks.

Anybody else had this problem???",4,"This seems to be another great product from CeraVe, but it sure is a pain for me because the pump doesn't work at all.  I've turned it and turned it, tried holding the inside part and turning the pump head - nothing worked.  It just sits there and won't pump.  So I have to pull the pump out and dump some in my hands every day.That said, it is a very nice lightweight lotion that doesn't feel greasy at all and doesn't have any noticeable scent.  I'll buy one more and hope THAT pump works.  If not, Amazon and CeraVe will hear from me, and I'll update this review.",0
