Cambió su formulación AGREGARON PARABENOS, NO TIENE QR autenticación, el olor ahora no es agradable",2,"Estoy muy decepcionada y triste a la vez ya que vengo siendo usuaria de Cerave hace unos años ya. La verdad soy de piel sensible y estos productos son los unicos que me han resultado dentro de tantos que habia probado sin exito. Compre esta locion ya que la anterior se me esta agotando y no me puede faltar y me encuentro con que el olor no tiene nada que ver con el de la que vengo usando y para mayor sorpresa aun cuando me fijo en los ingredientes le han agregado PARABENOS los cuales han sido cuestionados porque pueden tener impacto no positivos en la salud humana, ejemplo de lo que pueden provocar: Disrupción hormonal, Potencial carcinogénico, Sensibilización cutánea. Por mas que los porcentajes que utilicen se diga que son seguros considero que es mejor evitarlos. Es una pena que Cerave este haciendo esto, ojala y recapaciten y mas personas como yo se quejen a ver si vuelven a la formula anterior. Otra cosa que encontre es que no tiene codigo QR de autenticacion ni fecha de caducidad, lo cual si tiene todos los productos que tengo en casa. Esto hace siempre cuestionarse si son originales o son falsos. Ahi dejo fotos de ambas lociones la anterior y esta que compre aqui.",2

Not a Fan",2,"I am 65 years old with dry sensitive skin. My normal face cream was getting a bit expensive so I researched and found that this one was highly recommended. I have been trying it for the past week and a half and so far I have had 3 zits. In the past 12 years I've only had about 4 zits! I have no idea what is in this product that is making it do this to my face. The lotion itself is extremely thin. It feels like water and a little something else. One drop goes a loooong way. Also, mine didn't come in a tube like this, it actually came in a bottle with a pump. If it was in a tube it would just run out like water! Not happy at all.",0

Works for some but not for all",2,"I bought Cerve products before, none of them “wowed” me and I don’t understand the praise based on my experienced. The cleansers are mediocre but my face doesn’t feel clean. I use it for my first step of my double cleansing because of it.Next, their lotion. I don’t like the lotion for my face, but I like it for my body. Every time I use this moisturizer on my face, I get extremely oily. I thought it was because of my sunscreen so, I tried without it and I was overly oily. I do have combo skin but it was way too oily on every part of my face (not just my t zone).Honestly, I still would recommend you try it though. Cerve has some big stans and a lot of people really like their products so, you could potentially love it. It’s just not for my face and that’s okay. Ironically, I really love Walmarts version of this specific moisturizer on my face tho lol.",0

Lotion is too watery",2,"I love all CeraVe products. I figured their daily moisturizing lotion would meet my satisfaction. It doesn’t. It comes out very thin & watery. It’s not truly a lotion. It applies thinly & my skin is moisturized for a short period of time. I would reapply, I don’t bother anymore. I do not have dry skin so my skin isn’t in desperate need of major absorption. I just want my skin to be hydrated & this lotion fails at it. This is my least favorite lotion & I regret getting the 19 ounce bottle. There is a scent to it but it’s not overwhelming. I’ll stick with Eucerin or Gold Bond where I know once it’s applied I’m good to go. This lotion is definitely not for one with dry skin. I don’t recommend.",0

Old Formula Changed , Not Working For Sensitive Skin",2,"I just recently bought this Cerave moisturizing lotion (Lightweight texture). I had used Cerave moisturizing cream (one with the Thick texture) before and it was perfect for my sensitive skin and that’s the  reason why I bought it again. After using it just for one day I got 4-5 new whiteheads(milia) on my face and I still did not believe it (Because I had so great experience with this product before). So I kept using it for 2-3 more days but I was still seeing new whiteheads on my face. I searched on the internet whether Cerave has changed its ingredients for this product or not and then got to know that they have changed ingredients for this or may be all of its products and that’s the main reason why it’s not working for my skin now .Very disappointed, I hope they go back to their old formula",4

Breakouts",2,"Honestly, I'd been using this product for years, but I cannot recommend this product. After using topical retinol for quite some time now, this product does not agree with my skin and leads to cystic breakouts. I have NEVER dealt with cystic acne before. My skin would be disturbingly red after application and I would wake up in the mornings with very VERY oily skin. I stopped using this product and switched to something without all the alcohols and less ingredients overall and my skin issues were alleviated. If you're using retinol and CeraVe and your acne seems relentless, drop CeraVe from your routine and see if your skin improves.",0

Caused some crazy acne",2,"I have oily, acne-prone skin, but it still tends to get dry, especially in winter. I used to use the moisturizing cream but had heard the lotion was lighter and thought maybe that would be better for my skin. Nooo way! It made my skin feel the same kind of greasy as it does after I've been out in the heat and humidity all day, and it made me break out like crazy. Almost every time I put it on in the morning, I would have at least one giant zit by the time I got to work. I never have zits pop up that quickly and it ONLY happened when I used this lotion, so I can only imagine that was the cause. I'm  glad to read that this has worked for so many of you, but I figured I'd give a warning to people with acne problems that this could be a huge problem for their skin. I'm gonna go back to the moisturizing cream this winter.",15

Aggravated my Sensitive Skin",2,"I was very excited to use this product. Moisturizing, inexpensive, good for the skin barrier with plenty of ceramides? Heck yeah! But unfortunately it did not work for my skin. At first it was fine, and moisturized my skin well. About a week after I started to use it though, I'd get pimples in places where I wouldn't generally get them, like on my cheeks and temples and along my jaw line. When I stopped using it it decreased, but the scars are still there. Perhaps it's the petrolatum or maybe the alcohol that aggravated my skin. I am currently using it as a body moisturizer instead as the skin on my arms and legs isn't so sensitive like my face is. Very disappointed as I was so excited to use this. Will not buy again. I went back to just using aloe and badger Damascus rose oil for my dry, sensitive teenage skin.",14

Ineffective - not as good as their other lotions",2,I have sensitive and dry skin.  I have been using the CeraVe SA lotion for rough and bumpy skin for years and it's always worked great.  No reactions and very hydrating and effective.  I was frustrated that the price of that has gone up 50% compared to what I used to pay for it so I bought this instead.  Very disappointed.  It's a very thin feeling lotion that goes on well but has nearly zero hydrating affect on my skin.  The old lotion only needed to apply once per day to be effective.  My face is dry within hours after applying this lotion.  I will not buy this again.,3

Not the solution for me",2,"I purchased this, along with several other CeraVe products, after numerous recommendations from friends and reading reviews. I have sensitive, combination (leaning toward oily) skin, with osacea and some T-Zone breakouts. I've been searching for something that will calm my rosacea, not irritate my sensitive skin, and not eventually break-out my forehead. Well, unfortunately, the CeraVe products, including this one, are not the solution. My sensitive skin and rosacea were not irritated by this moisturizer, but it did leave my skin with a stickiness and caused my forehead to break-out. Since this lotion appears to be good for any part of the body needing extra sensitive care, I decided to try it as a regular body lotion - it's awfully expensive to just throw away. It works fairly well as a regular lotion, but I don't care for the scent that comes on my skin - it almost smells like stale water. Perhaps that's just my skin reacting to it, though, as it doesn't smell that way in the bottle.",0

Did not moisturize well",2,"To be considered a ""lotion for dry skin"" it wasn't at all moisturizing. It left my skin feeling and looking very dry, (especially during the winter months) more than other 'normal' lotions like Jergens. Vaseline lotion (not the cream or petroleum jelly) and Aveeno lotion for dry skin have also worked better for me but I was really rooting for this one because of the ceramides and hyaluronic acid. For now I've gone back to what works.",0

But the top of my skin would look like I skinny dipped in cooking oil and underneath there ...",2,"This is one of those lotions that I've read rave reviews about, have heard nothing but glowing things about, but when I tried it, it didn't work.I don't know what kind of skin everyone else has, but this lotion gave me the shiniest, greasiest, driest skin ever. I don't even know how that's possible. But the top of my skin would look like I skinny dipped in cooking oil and underneath there would be almost scales (as if the lotion wasn't penetrating no matter how much I rubbed it in). I tried different portion sizes, different applying techniques, everything. Nothing worked.This moisturizer reminds me of the girl in school that everyone thinks is pretty, but no matter how much I turn my head and squint, I just can't see it.Far be it from me to tell you all that you're wrong though.",0

It may seem cheaper to buy on amazon, but it is watered down. I would rather pay full price from the store, knowing that the ingredients and packaging, along with the overall consistency is different. It's a lot thicker when you buy the authentic version.",2

It's not unbearable and you dont smell it after a few minutes but its definitely offputting.Works pretty well otherwise it's not oily and it absorbs fast I use it on my face and it helps the winter dry out.So if you can tolerate a little smell go for it, but maybe try to find a less offensive smelling lotion if you can.",14

Disappointed",2,"I ordered this to use as a facial moisturizer. I would consider my skin normal - not oily or particularly dry. After having tried it every morning for almost a week now (by itself with no make-up) I don't care for it at all. It leaves a sticky, tacky  film/residue on my face that's still noticeable at bedtime. I thought maybe I could finish the bottle by using it as a hand and body lotion, but I'm not impressed. It doesn't do much to moisturize or soften the skin on my hands or legs either. I have several other, similarly priced lotions that do a much better job. I won't be purchasing this again.",2

It does not have a pleasant odor ...it smells like dead fish. Three of us all had the same reaction. The smell does dissipate somewhat after a few minutes, but not completely.Too bad, I was looking for a Lubriderm replacement, but this isn't it. It goes on very much like Lubriderm and has the same consisteny and no greasy feel, but the odor ...yuck!",3
