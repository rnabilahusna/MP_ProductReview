Did not live up to the hype. No positive results.",2.0,"I purchased this moisturizer because of all the great reviews and also how this brand is praised by skincare gurus and influencers.Unfortunately this moisturizer did absolutely nothing positive for me. Firstly, after application, even when using a very small amount, it leaves a 'silicone makeup primer feeling' on my face. It also never feels like it sinks in, like it just sits on top. It also has a tendency to pill up, again, even when using a very small amount.Furthermore,  I understand purging when using new skincare products, however the breakouts never stopped. Even after weeks and months. (I purchased it twice because the brand has such a positive reputation). Also, if I had any healing blemishes, this moisturizer made my face sting heavily with every single application.Because of all of the above, I just cannot recommend and will not be purchasing again.",0

Wanted To Love This So Bad",2.0,"I heard rave reviews about this product. Upon using the product it felt a little thick thus hard to spread on my face but still manageable. I really loved everything about it including the fact it has SPF, until I noticed the piling. I used it overnight and my face was shedding so bad from the product. After some research I realize more people had the same problem as I did than I could have imagined. Someone said even testing a patch on their arm the piling was occurring so it's definitely something to do with the product and not my skin, I even exfoliated, tested it out, and same problem. It's a shame because I loved how it felt on my skin but I will not be giving this LRP product another chance. I do love their Toleriane cleanser, however this did not compare",0

Not good for sensitive skin and pills",2.0,"I really wanted to like this product. It’s really hot on social media and I thought it would be great for barrier repair and sensitive skin. It stings whenever I use it and it also pills. I would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin. In fact I’ve seen some other comments / videos that people with sensitive skin should avoid LRP. I find French products harsh, I’ll be going back to Skinfix.",0

Greasy",2.0,"My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer with sunscreen. She said it was light and not greasy. Sadly, she was wrong. It’s very greasy and shiny on my face. I thought that might go away once it soaks in, but it doesn’t. The only plus side is that it doesn’t make my face break out.  I won’t be using this brand again.",0

Pills",2.0,Unfortunately this was a no go for me. It just pilled so bad and I could not layer anything on top. I also did not feel like it moisturized my face like I needed. It felt like it sat on my skin and never actually soaked in. I like La Roche-Posay products but this just didn't work out sadly.,0

Not for combination/oily skin",2.0,"I have combination skin where some areas are dry and other areas are oily. I don’t have an acne issue but after using this moisturizer for about 2-3 weeks, I noticed it was making my skin more oily and creating breakouts. It’s too thick for my skin. I didn’t realize it was from this moisturizer until I stopped moisturizing and went back to normal. I usually use Roc which I don’t have an issue with but this La Roche didn’t work well with my skin. It’s a great product for people that don’t have my skin type.",0

I usually try to give products longer than that but my skin, especially around eyes and mouth became red, flaky, and painfully tender. I am still trying to get my skin back to normal. It also left my skin feeling tight and like a powdery residue was on it. I’ve heard great things about this brand but it just didn’t work for me. Maybe I’m sensitive to an ingredient?",0

Don't use with oil-based foundation...",2.0,"If I apply it at night, I have no issues. However, don't plan on your foundation adhering to your face when you apply it in the morning. I use Bare Minerals foundation, and when I use this moisturizer, it comes away from my face in little shavings and clumps. I've never had this happen with any other moisturizer, and I can only assume that because it is not oil-based, it repels any foundation that is. Beware.",0

Not Very Moisturizing",2.0,This is not ok for deep moisture. It doesn’t leave skin feeling hydrated or soft-almost like paper. This is not your choice for dry skin. FYI the sunscreen in it is useless as well. Do yourself a favor and get a rich moisturizer and a separate sunscreen. My dermatologist even noticed how bad my skin was after using this stuff for 3 weeks. Terrible,2

Harsh for Sensitive Skin.",2.0,"This product was recommended by several You-Tube Dermatologists and very well endorsed, unfortunately, the formulation causes irritation, drying and peeling especially around the eyes.  This is the 2nd tube I've purchased and now realize its much to harsh due to the Niacinamide and Ceramides used in the formulation.  Both of which I'm sensitive to and found that out the hard way. There's a good reason why the high-end moisturizers and creams are better tolerated on the skin especially when using Niacinamide and Ceramides. Drug store brands need to be carefully used especially on mature skin.",0

I wanted to love it",2.0,"I stated using this to help with my flaking skin from my prescription retinols.  I tossed all my other moisturizers with fragrance and that weren’t working and committed to this.  My flaking has stopped but I believe it’s more to do with changing my face wash. This pills horribly. For the price it doesn’t feel luxurious on my skin and I’m not sure it’s even worth it. I have to put on a soaking wet face after a shower or warm face wash to get it to even absorb just a bit.  Forget about layering with anything else or makeup. I’ll be returning it and trying something else instead.Edit to add: I read some other reviews and decided to buy a bottle at target.  NO PILLING! With the Amazon one I had to go through this whole ritual of washing my face, leaving it damp, putting in the LP cream, letting it dry and adding my retinol cream. I had to cut out any serums after that.With the target one I did my ritual with good results. Then I decided to just go ahead put on my LP cream (it absorbs faster and doesn’t just sit on my skin) wait a second, put on my retinols, and added my serum back info my routine. No pilling again. Maybe the Amazon version is old or coming from a different facility.",0

3 out of 10",2.0,I bought this to put on my face at night and in the morning before my make routine. Problem is it burns my eyes. Even if I try not to get it close to my eyes it stings. Not sure if this is some kind of reaction to the ingredients? Also it’s probably not a good night moisturizer for night use because of the SPF. It says broad spectrum SPF in light yellow letters.

Didn't work for me",2.0,"I have very dry patches of bumpy skin on my cheeks from keratosis pilaris. Very few products work. I tried this and saw no improvement in the bumps. On the bright side, it does tend to pill and I used it to pill and exfoliate my face. I put the lotion on, let it set, then cleanse my face really well and then some dead skin comes off. Hence why I give it 2 stars, not 1. It isn't perfumed and has a negligible medicinal scent. The tube doesn't last too long (less than a month for me with pretty minimal amounts used every evening) and seems expensive for how much product you really get. I think it's worth a try but doesn't work for kp sufferers. I had better luck with Hydroboost by Neutrogena or the gel moisturizer by Clinique.",0

I am using a retinoid on my face so my skin peels off like crazy, and I thought it was cream pieces. I decided tot test on my inner forearm and the cream stays on (and gets absorbed) perfectly on my forearm skin no matter how much I tried rubbing it to cross out the peeling off issue. Yes, it is indeed a good cream. I amstill surprised that my generous use did not waste the whole pack.My skin stings though while on a strong retinoid when I use this cream. This is not entirely the cream’s problem but will remove one star for it, as Vanicream doesn’t sting my skin. Maybe they could make the ingredients slightly less irritating?",0

Not for all users with rosacea",2.0,"I recently found out that I have rosacea, and after going through all these recommended products for rosacea, someone was raving about La Roche-Posay moisturizer. I was really excited to try this out since I found out 90% of my skincare products were just a big no for me now. Well, let me tell you, other rosacea sufferers, that this moisturizer is just not for everyone. Here's why.This moisturizer stings - yes, it stings! Like, ouch! Upon applying it on my face that was washed with a sensitive-skin friendly cleanser, I put a dab of this moisturizer on my face and could feel it starting to sting. Then, the rosacea would appear brightly on my face. On top of that, my face felt extremely oily as if it was from this moisturizer. Now, the moisturizer does say that it's oil-free; however, it really didn't feel like it.One plus thing about this moisturizer is that after applying it on my face, I didn't have any more of that itchiness. I do think it is doing its job as moisturizing, but it's also triggering my rosacea.Also, if anyone is using the Cetaphil sunblock along with this moisturizer, I do advise you to use it with care. I'll write a review for that sunblock, but these two do not mix well.",7

May be others' cup of tea, but not mine",2.0,"The only reason I dislike this moisturizer so much is because of the rolling. Like, if you move your fingers across your face or try to swipe on makeup, it looks like your skin's peeling off...I liked it initially because it goes on very light and SEEMED to absorb well. My skin felt moisturized, but anytime I put on makeup or rubbed my skin, it looked like I recently got a facial peel. I thought at first it was another product I was using, but after I stopped using the other product, my skin didn't stop looking like it was peeling after putting on moisturizer. Over time I've realized that it's just the moisturizer rolling off, not my skin, and underneath it, my skin doesn't actually feel that moisturized after all (once the moisturizer rolls off). It appears to absorb very well, so it's hard to tell how much you've put on. If you put on very, very little, you won't have the peeling. But, you also won't have any moisturizing. It's a catch 22.Pros: absolutely for sensitive skin - I had no problems with it ACTUALLY peeling my skin or anything crazyPeople seem to like this, so maybe it's just me, but it's an expensive moisturizer that just peels off and doesn't seem to do much.",3

This is a sunscreen with moisturizer, not a moisturizer with sunscreen.",2.0,"Update: it's as I feared.  This product is too thick and greasy, never fully absorbs into the skin and you cannot put makeup over it without pilling.  I did not see any changes to my skin.  I will not be purchasing this product again.I will come back later to update, but on arrival I am disappointed because this product is not what I wanted. I wanted a facial moisturizer with spf, as advertised, but this is a sunscreen with moisturizers.I know that some will think it's the same thing or I'm being petty, but they are completely different things. The thickness and the way sunscreen absorbs vs a moisturizer with spf is night and day. Sunscreen tends to pill under makeup as well while moisturizers are better designed to be used in layers on the face. This is thicker and greasier feeling than I wanted.I am definitely willing to give it a shot and I hope I eat my words, but I really also hope that the seller advertises it as sunscreen because that's what it is.I'll be back in a month to update!",148

Excellent Product - Poor delivery handling",2.0,"As someone with sensitive skin who’s used this product for many years, I can vouch for this being an excellent and reliable moisturizer. A little goes a long way with this one, so the bottle should last you for a while. 5 stars for the product itself.That being said, I’m giving my Amazon order 2 stars ONLY because it arrived on time and was the correct product.I ordered this off of Amazon as a gift for a friend, but the outside packaging was battered and torn. It actually looked like it had been opened. I had to return it because there’s no way I could gift something that arrived in terrible condition that could’ve been tampered with. My advise? Ordering this on Amazon is risky. You can always pick this up at your local CVS for about the same price.",9

I was a loyal customer, but I won’t be buying their products anymore. Very disappointed.",2.0,"UPDATE: this update is a few months late, but I did hear back from their customer service. They first told me to try the product without using any toner or oil underneath. Then they said to go to  dermatologist and get my skin checked. Apparently it’s a product that can only be used by people with perfect skin. I have pretty good skin, and I’ve never had this problem with any other moisturizer. What a shame. Don’t buy this project.Original Review-I used to love La Roche-Posay. I’ve been using their cleansers for a long time. I wanted to give their moisturizer and their sunscreen a try, but I am very disappointed. Like other reviews, this product causes a lot of pilling. I’m only able to use this on my face right now because of the quarantine I don’t go out much. Don’t use this moisturizer with makeup. Prior to writing this review I reached out to their customer service asking if it’s an old moisturizer or I should use a different product, but I got no response. I also got their melt-in sunscreen from cvs and that was also disappointing. Super greasy and its definitely not meant to be used with makeup. Unfortunately I can’t return it due to covid19 restrictions. I really wanted to love this brand, but I don’t think I’ll get their products anymore.",33

Even when I wash my face I feel like it’s still on me. A little goes a long way even if you have dry skin. I don’t recommend it and I will be purchasing a different one I hate it.

It's alright",2.0,"I wanted to get the regular moisturizer but got the one with sunscreen idk why. I dont like it honestly. Makes your skin look oily af. Plus on the YUKA app it tells you this is apparently bad since it has ingredients that cause sun allergy which is what I have and it sucks so much if I'm in the sun for too long. This basically boosts that up. Smh. I thought LRP is good after all the hype about it but guess not. CeraVe is bad, Aveeno is ok. LRP is ok so far. Nothing from their line has helped me with my skin concerns. I might as well switch to Korean brands",0

Maybe get the one right sunscreen",2.0,"So I’ve been using this product for a full month now and I’ve got my honest review. I really wanted to like this product more than I do. I’ve heard such great things, however, this product just doesn’t feel moisturizing or hydrating on my skin at all. It has a thick consistency which may be due to the sunscreen in it but it feels heavy on my face and none soothing at all. Moisturizing has always been my favorite part of my skincare routine but this stuff just doesn’t do it for me. My face has been breaking out which normally I’m not sensitive to either. Overall, it’s okay and I like that there isn’t a scent. I’ll probably use the rest for neck and arms sunscreen. But I think I prefer my moisturizer and sunscreen to be applied separately.",0

It doesn’t dry down and after a while all I could taste was sunblock even though I had avoided my lip area (since I use a lip specific sun protectant). I wear makeup often and and don’t like how this wears under my makeup, I do like that it’s unscented and made for sensitive skin. I’ll use the rest of the bottle but won’t purchase again. I also don’t appreciate that the company isn’t cruelty free. This is something I typically look for in my products and somehow missed when purchasing this. I will not purchase this again.",5

Yep, it pills.",2.0,"This would be perfectly fine if it didn’t pill so badly. Another reviewer implied that people are using the product wrong and the pilling is just dead skin from not exfoliating. That is incorrect. As someone who takes very good care of my skin, and exfoliates regularly, this is just a crappy product. The pilling is balled up dried moisturizer. It’s too bad because it has a lot of good qualities, but the pilling issue makes it unusable. I can’t use it at night because I need a heavier moisturizing cream at night, and I can’t use it in the morning because it will destroy my makeup.

After reading many positive reviews by people who touted its efficacy for sensitive skin I was looking forward to trying it. Unfortunately this particular product didn’t live up to my hopes. While it says it’s non-comodegenic, after just a few days my skin felt/looked like my pores were very clogged, and I broke out in several tender blemishes.
