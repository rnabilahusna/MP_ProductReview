DO NOT BUY THIS...",5.0,"UNLESS you want your skin to be AMAZING ✨️. I've tried so many moisturizers but they all feel super thick and heavy, but this... THIS! This product feels amazing on my skin. It works just as described and even though it's an SPF moisturizer, meaning it'll have a thicker consistency, it's so light, soft and blends really well. It leaves my skin happy the entire day.",18

Great",5.0,"This is a truly great moisturizer, especially for the price.  I like it better than the $80 one I use to use. Light weight, doesn’t break me out and have noticed just after using about a month that my skin is smoother and looks more evened out. Highly recommend.",5

A little covers a lot.",5.0,I will be using this product forever. It goes flawlessly over your skin and you can’t tell you have anything on. It is very light weight and a little goes a long way a really long long way. It helped my skin from the first time I put it on. I thought cause it was light weight it wouldn’t condition or sooth my dry sensitive skin well but I was wrong. I was blown away. It has solved my dry patches completely. After 1 week my barrier is back strong. It’s incredible.,3

A Hydration Hero for Sensitive Skin - La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer",5.0,"As someone with sensitive skin, finding the perfect daily moisturizer has often felt like a daunting task. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer has proven to be a game-changer, providing the ideal balance of hydration and skin-loving ingredients.What sets this moisturizer apart is its commitment to catering to sensitive skin needs. The fragrance-free formula is a breath of fresh air, especially for those prone to irritation. The lightweight texture absorbs effortlessly into the skin, leaving no greasy residue behind. This makes it perfect for both morning and evening use, seamlessly integrating into my skincare routine.The inclusion of ceramides and niacinamide in the formulation is a standout feature. These ingredients not only hydrate the skin but also work to strengthen its natural barrier. Over time, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health of my skin. It feels more resilient, and I've experienced a noticeable reduction in redness and sensitivity.The moisturizer's versatility makes it suitable for all seasons. During colder months, it provides a comforting layer of hydration, while in the warmer months, it doesn't feel heavy or clog pores. The pump dispenser ensures a hygienic application, and a little goes a long way, making the product cost-effective.One of the most impressive aspects of this moisturizer is its compatibility with other skincare products. It plays well with serums, sunscreen, and makeup, making it an excellent base for a layered skincare routine. I appreciate that it doesn't pill or cause any product interference.In terms of packaging, the sleek tube is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. It's travel-friendly, and the secure cap prevents any accidental spills or leaks.La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer has become my holy grail for daily hydration. Its gentle yet effective formula has transformed my sensitive skin, leaving it supple, calm, and well-nourished. If you're on the hunt for a reliable daily moisturizer that caters to sensitive skin, look no further – this one is a winner. Highly recommended.",9

It's next-level good",5.0,"I've heard about this for a while now & finally decided to give it a try. The very first time, I put it on my face, I could tell it was a different kind of moisturizer.(BTW, if you are experiencing ""pilling"" and flaking with this, I would verify the authenticity. I had no problems like that and my face was clean but not freshly washed. The next time I used it, I used sunscreen over it and had no problems either. Try checking with La Roche online to see if you can verify by the markings on the container.)PROS:--The texture is light but not thin. I didn't have to use but a pea-sized amount for each half of my face and another for my neck.-- No fragrance at all.-- It glides very easily onto the skin. After I applied it and let it rest for about a full minute, my skin was so soft that it felt a bit ""padded"". I couldn't feel the moisturizer because it had completely absorbed. BTW, the first time I used this, I purposely used nothing else - no Hyaluronic or toner or anything.-- The results are pretty incredible and I can use the phrase about my skin feeling soft as a baby's bottom!My face did have a very slight tingling after the first application. It wasn't unpleasant but I kept an eye on it just in case. It abated after a while. I was reading somewhere that the tingling could be due to either a sensitivity to the level of niacinamide or because my skin barrier is compromised. In any case, I did not have this problem with the next application.CON:--The outer box was unsealed and there was no foil or plastic seal protecting the lotion. This made me hesitate and I wonder if other users had a seal or not. My tube seemed a bit flat also - like there might be some cream missing.OVERALL: This is a straight win & I will even call it a holy grail product. Even in between applying this moisturizer, I feel like I have had a fresh facial, an exfoliation, some serum, and a moisturizer. Since this worked so well, the only other thing I wanted to test was how long the hydration lasts. On the first day, I put it on as soon as I got the package (at about 5 pm) and decided to see if my face was still moisturized when waking the next morning. The result? Yes, my face was just as supple and hydrated as when I went to sleep. It's humid here and I usually end up wiping moisturizers and sunscreens off while constantly patting my face dry. I am not having to reapply this, no matter how many times I blot my face during the day.I have already ordered the version with SPF but went direct to the U.S. site. I don't like that my tube seemed not to be quite full. There was no safety seal so I have no idea if it was used or what. Plus, I get samples if I buy from the official site.My 62nd birthday is today and while I have good skin, I am getting those little dark ""freckles"" (aka age spots! LOL), and just after a few days of using this, my skin looks and feels more supple and healthy. I can almost swear the age spots are getting less noticeable!",214

Magic in a bottle: I’m 33- 4th update at bottom",5.0,"There I was.It was a Tuesday, mid October, 2018. I’m pacing Walgreens skin care aisle, reading labels up & down. Sweaty & hormonal, pregnant & confused.There she was; the esthetician angel hired by Walgreens. She approaches me.“How can I help you?” I look at her, she looks at me. She must be in her 60s? But her skin looks flawless. (Seriously do pores just disappear at her age?) She doesn’t even have wrinkles, except for some beautifully placed smile lines.“Sure,” I mumble; clearly disheartened. “My face is freaking out. I’ve spent $100+ these last few months trying to fix it. I’ve never had an issue-before this pregnancy- & I don’t know what’s wrong with my skin!” I continue to vent hormonally, “Breaking out, greasy one moment & dry & flaky the next-“She nods her head up & down as I speak, eyes shimmering in understanding behind her rimless glasses. She’s been here before.“Have you tried La Roche moisturizer? It’s probiotic thermal water works miracles.”I haven’t of course.My fairy godmother (for who else could this angel be?) hands me the unsuspecting bottle. $20 dollars? I scoff inwardly at the high price tag, not fully understanding yet what a gift this is.SPF or no spf? (It doesn’t matter I later find out, they both were made by the beautiful witches of the west & represent it.)It worked that very night. My face literally healed in 24 hours. (Read the back of the bottle. It does what it says)18 months later, I’m on my 5th bottle. My face is supple, even, and I barely wear makeup. (cc cream by it, & that’s it.)It’s magical. Whats in this bottle? Sorcery perhaps?“ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC”My only wish is it came in a bigger bottle.*ive added a photo with myself wearing it cc cream, but you can see my face looks lovely. Thank you fairy god mother of science. THANK YOU**Update: 2022Just ordered another bottle. Read some reviews & wanted to comment about the “pilling”. The pilling is dead skin….exfoliate before. I’m on my, like 10th? bottle or something. From personal experience I’ve noticed if I don’t exfoliate & just “put it on” without properly cleaning & taking care of my face-pilling WILL happen. I actually take it as an indication I need to take better care of my face.I wasn’t paid anything for this review.Not even a “give us a good review & you get a free bottle” discount. WHICH I AM cool with.I personally take those little postcards as offensive little star-grabbing buggards messing with the review system.Anywho. My hair is longer in the 2nd photo…that’s how long I’ve been using this lotion. My kid is a toddler & we’re looking for baby #2…Never going without this stuff as I can tell when I don’t moisturize & maintain my “protective layer” on my skin with this magic lotion. Cheers to less blotchy, angry, skin peeps.WINTER 2024 Update:I have a problem- it’s too darn dry and this (while I still love it)- isn’t combatting the extreme dryness of Wisconsin. I needed a solution.I found the “triple repair moisturizing cream for face & body”. It’s basically the same stuff but thicker and creamier for extreme dry skin.As I’ve aged, my skin has been very hormonal.I’ve incorporated snail mucin cosRx as well. It’s been helping and my acne (scattered painful bumps that I pick at and then they become cystic & hyperpigmentatied because I never learn my lesson) has improved.So- this product, snail mucin w/ a red light therapy tool called solawave, with the thicker cream version of this at night. It’s definitely helping. More updates to come.",0

Amazing!",5.0,"I’ve tried quite a few moisturizers, but none compare to this one. It is without a doubt the best one I’ve ever gotten and will be buying again. I have super sensitive skin and struggle with hormonal breakouts so I am very wary of what I decide to try on my skin. Due to breakouts I’d use topical creams and they caused dry, flaky patches that wouldn’t go away no matter how many times I moisturized. I have a La Roche Posay cleanser so I took a leap of faith and it has been everything for my skin. It’s hydrating, light and my face feels amazing. Truly worth every penny.",0

Great daily Sun protection",5.0,"I live in Florida and use this on my face every day. I often get compliments on my skin and I’m sure some of that is genetics, but some of it is because I have used sunscreen on my face every day since I was 16. There were times I ended up at the beach unexpectedly and only had this with me and used it on my arms and legs too, and did not burn. (I was not playing in the water, and I’m very pale skinned.) I recently tried a competitor’s product, but it left terrible white cast on my skin. I’ll stick with this!",0

Superior Product",5.0,"I had been using a face moisturizer for years from a retailer and never wanted to switch brands until the price jumped out of reach. I was forced to look for an alternative and I must say I am thrilled about this product. Not only does it moisturize without leaving my face greasy but a small amount goes much farther than my former moisturizer, although maybe I shouldn’t post this for fear of price increases. I highly recommend trying this.",0

I have EXTRA sensitive skin and I couldn't find a sunblock or moisturizer that wouldn't irritate me or give me acne. THIS here,game changer. My face looks healthier than ever.. doesn't feel oily or anything like that. Goes on perfectly under my makeup. I now use mostly this brand in my skin routine.

Breakout Free",5.0,Love this product. I struggle to find moisturizers that keep my face moisturized enough in the winter without going overboard and breaking me out. This one is perfect.

Perfect under makeup!",5.0,I am someone who often forgoes SPF because it would always cause my makeup to pill. I tried this and did not have that issue.

I’m a Believer",5.0,"At 52, I have reached the point where my love of sun and hatred of sunscreen back in the day, have produced pre-cancerous spots on my face and chest - oh yay. I promised my dermatologist that I’d use a moisturizer with sunscreen. UGH… have you noticed how many are out there that give the dreaded “white cast” on your face or are SO thick feeling on your skin you swear its a joke and your husband replaced it with pudding on April Fools Day.But not this stuff!!!! I did the searches and read articles trying to find something that (first) wasn’t heavy, didn’t make me look like Casper the Friendly Ghost, or smelled like sunblock. I used Ole’s newly created 30 SPF moisturizer sunscreen but it felt sticky and didn’t feel “healthy” on my face, if that makes sense. I was devastated because I love all things Ole.Then I decided that I’d give this stuff a go. GAME CHANGER! It smells nice, isn’t heavy, and has a very minimal white cast (and that’s only if you use a ton; which you won’t because a little goes a long way!) Now remember I said I was a sun loving kid and lived through the “baby oil is best sunblock,” so I have some dark spots, little lines, discolorations etc. literally everything stereotypical of my generation. (Ha!) Well, NOT ANYMORE! I am completely serious when I say my dark spots are almost completely invisible, lines look smoother - the whole deal!Super long story short, I’m dropping the brand I’ve used everyday for over a decade, to use this stuff. The cleanser, vitamin C serum,  you name it. Now click on that “Add to cart” button NOW!",17

Perfect for me",5.0,"So, until I turned 40, I did not care about skin routines, so I did not have one.  After turning 40, I figured I should start taking care of my skin, so I did some fairly in-depth research online on products that would work for my mixed (oily/dry) skin without my having to get a second job or second mortgage.  This product was the leader for that category. I should also note that I do not wear makeup, so I do not know how this product impacts makeup application.I have paired this moisturizer with a cleanser for sensitive skin, and I use it every morning at least.  This moisturizer provides just enough moisturization to make my skin feel soft and glowy without adding to any of my T-zone issues.  I have had no issues with pore clogging or skin reactions to this moisturizer, and I have grown to love it.  There is very little scent, and whatever is there does not last long, so that is not an issue for me. I can now feel when I have forgotten to put it on, and my skin is obviously happier with it.  Overall, I am thrilled with this product.",5

Great Moisturizer Making a difference",5.0,"This is one of the best products I have used! The niacinamide has helped to clear up my hyperpigmentation in conjunction with the tretinoin. I have dry sensitive skin - that has been a lifesaver, especially with the harsh winter skin. A little goes a long way. I use a pea size and apply only to the areas that for myself get the driest ( cheeks, nose area, and chin. I spread sparingly to my forehead). I also add a dab under my eyes before applying concealer which helps. They tend to be dry as well, using a smaller amount than a pea size.Long story short, great product. It is expensive (use sparingly), but I will continue to use. I am sure I will use less in the summer, but will continue to purchase.",0

Heals without stinging",5.0,"I think this is the third review I've written on anything in my life, but I thought this review would be of help.If you have any kind of facial skin irritation, dryness, scrapes, or just general tiredness, this is the stuff you want.  The price looks insane, but after using just a dime size amount, your problems are gone the next morning.I had chafing on my eyes, eyelids, forehead, nose from an extreme work schedule of 6 days on with overtime, in a very nasty environment.  Masks, gloves, particulate matter, and a general backside whoopin daily.  My eyes and skin started to crack and scab from the abuse.I got this stuff.  Applied it at night after washing, and thought it didn't take much to apply.  Also doesn't sting like most other under $10 products.  Rubbed it into my eyelids- no burning.  It stayed where you put it.  So that was nice.But even nicer is that when I woke the next day, my face had healed.  No roughness, scratches, or abrasions to be found.  And beyond that, I even looked 'younger', if that's even a thing.  I don't particularly care about that part, but I do care about my body getting torn to shreds.  And this fixed it.So manly men out there, drop some coin on this if you are getting hit with skin damage on the regular.  This stuff works so well I'm almost afraid to see what's really in it.  And this is likely my last review for this decade.  Thanks to the people that made it.  Take care.",35

Let me tell you, this product absolutely deserves all the hype it gets.This moisturizer is nothing short of a super moisturizer! It keeps my face hydrated all day long, and I never have to worry about that dreaded dry, ashy feeling again. It's become an essential part of my skincare routine, and I can confidently say it's one of the best moisturizers I've ever used.
