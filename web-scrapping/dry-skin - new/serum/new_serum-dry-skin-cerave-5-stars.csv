This has a very smooth, rich feel to it",5.0,"Most of all, I like the feel of this product - it is a cream (not a gel) and it has a very rich consistency.  My skin is quite dry and this product makes my skin feel moisturized without feeling greasy.  I use it every morning before my moisturizer.  (I use something even more moisturizing at night, but again I have very dry skin).  I also like that it has virtually no scent (which I prefer).  This replaced a more expensive daytime serum I was using that was nice, but not worth the money.  For the price, I think this serum can't be beat - it's a very hydrating product that offers great value.  (Also, I read that some reviewers noted consistency issues - I had none.  Consistency of mine has been perfect).  I highly recommend it.",6

The Secret to My Clear Skin Routine",5.0,"After incorporating CeraVe into my daily skincare routine, I've experienced a remarkable transformation in my skin. I start with the La Roche Posay Purifying Foaming Face Wash, followed by the Neutrogena Stubborn Texture Serum with Niacinamide. Then comes the star of the show, the CeraVe serum, which has become a staple in my regimen. Its hydrating and nourishing properties have contributed to the newfound clarity of my skin. To seal the deal, I finish with the La Roche Posay Face Moisturizer Sunscreen Toleriane, featuring Ceramide and Niacinamide. These four products together have not only enhanced the texture of my skin but also garnered compliments on my radiant complexion. CeraVe has undoubtedly earned its place in my skincare arsenal, making it a must-have for anyone seeking a clear and glowing complexion.",44

My skin is basically addicted to this!",5.0,"I found this product a few years ago when I learned a bit about hyaluronic acid and tried it. The affect was great, my skin got smooth and it just felt like the quality of my skin got better. I stopped using it a few months ago and omg. Break outs, huge pores, haggard appearance. I promise it all came to fruition.I thought, ok it’ll clear up on its own if I just keep my face clean. It honestly didn’t improve. I went ahead and bought this product again. And it’s honestly only been a week since I brought back into my routine and already my skin quality has shown drastic improvement. The breakouts have settled, my pores have minimized, and I look better.I’ve tried other versions of hyaluronic acid and they down have the same effect. I do try to stay with cerave brand with all my products. I have sensitive skin so finding a brand that doesn’t make me break out in a rash. I’ve learned my lesson though and this product will always be in my routine from now on.",27

Best product ever purchased for my sking!",5.0,"I read that Hyalaronic acid was an immediate positive  for dry skin so I decided to try this item. That advice turned out, was an under statement! I'm in my sixties, live in an arid climate and have used dozens if not hundreds of products (many that were $100 a bottle) to help my older dry skin. None of those ever made much of a difference. Literally the first 24 hours after applying this product to my face, followed by moisturizer per instructions, my skin felt AMAZING! I selected the Cerave product since I already trust in their products. I use Cerave daily moisturizer for daytime and Cerave Skin renewing Night cream at night. They were ok but now the difference is like Night and Day (pun intended :) This is only day 3 and this has truly changed my skin for the better immediately!",18

Punches way above its weight - try before you spend too much money on designer stuff",5.0,"Just bought this tiny little bottle of HA and I'm actually really happy with it. I've used a few HA serums before and they always left my face feeling sticky and unpleasant. This is more like a lotion that feels quite luxurious to the face and disappears INSTANTLY into the skin (maybe my skin is just thirsty). I like Cerave products because there are other actives in them besides the main one, so I feel like I get a lot more for my money than I would if I were to buy the comparable product from like Obagi. As a daily moisturizer this really makes your skin feel good, especially if you deal with sensitive skin issues after things like shaving or if you have dry skin. I use this to treat slightly dry skin on my face that also has textural issues and fine lines (33 yo so it be like that I guess) in combo with other products that are easily 10x as expensive for the same volume, but I regret those Alle purchases because this gave me a 60% improvement on my skin issues overnight fml.Good stuff, try this before you spend another $400 on med-spa level stuff.",48
