WARNING:  Can't get the second bottle to work and no way to get help.",1.0,"I like this cream and I think it is helpful.  I've been using it daily.  Last September I ordered two (minimum order) and just depleted the first bottle.  Fortunately, I thought, there was another bottle still in the package in my cabinet.  Not so fortunately, when I unpacked it and tried to get the second one to work, nothing would come out.  I have tried everything but I can't get anything out of this bottle.  So it was a waste of money and I am pretty angry that I can't reach anyone at the supplier.  Thus this review.",0

Horrible!!!",1.0,"First of all this is not a serum.  A serum by definition is watery and not an opaque cream.  I would say this actually falls under false advertising because the product says it’s one thing but it is clearly not.  Also, the product is heavy on the skin and is clogging my pores.  The product states that it can also be layered under your moisturizer but feels gross and has this slick silicone feel.  This was my first time purchasing this and will be my last.  I will be returning it and contacting Cerave directly.  Absolutely do not buy!!!!",3

Contents swapped? Beware of the great reviews!",1.0,"The bottle I received contained an extremely thick, dry, opaque white lotion, not a serum. The lotion is so thick, it holds the shape of the pump opening. This is not a serum, not hydrating, and bears no resemblance to the product description. I wondered initially if I just got an old bottle where the serum was mostly dried out but it’s completely inconsistent with the color and texture described. All I can think is that the contents were swapped for a cheap alternative.",10

Bad moisturizer",1.0,"I’m not sure why I kept using this. It’s a horrible moisturizer. Yes I know it says it’s a serum on the packaging, but my derm and the Cerave website say this can be used as a moisturizer so that’s what I did. Honestly, this is bad both as a serum and a moisturizer anyway. It doesn’t sink in to the skin at all, it pills like crazy with almost all products and even on its own, and I tried applying it many different ways-on its own, on dry skin, damp skin, after toner, after some serum, but it always pills and does not hydrate whatsoever (I mean, how could it when it doesn’t absorb into the skin and just sits on top with a weird slick finish). But the worst thing is that it gave me some horrid bout of closed comedones which I didn’t expect it to since Cerave always claims to be non-comedogenic, but I found that a lot of their products are, including this one. Once I stopped using it, the comedonal acne and bumpy texture improved within 3 days.",13

It's ....not a serum. It's not even a lotion, it's a cream and very drying.",1.0,"I'm honestly in shock. I've never hated a Cerave product before. It's a very thick, white cream, not a serum at all. It has a very drying effect and is also kind of irritating, so I imagine someone with sensitive skin should avoid it. I bought it a couple of months ago while I finished my Olay supply and I'm VERY sorry I didn't try it sooner so I could return it.",7

Good prooduct, lousy packaging",1.0,"I've used this product before and liked it.  I've read comments from other users saying the pump on the cannister wouldn't work and they had to throw it out.  That hadn't happened to me until now.  The top doesn't unscrew and isn't mean to be removed, but I used my heavy duty wrench and got it off.  It was obvious why the pump wouldn't work...the contents had solidified from a lightweight lotion to a viscous cream.  I dug it out with a knife and put it in another container.  It works fine, but the lotion lasted a long time whereas I have to use more of the cream and it's already nearly gone.  There are other brands of hyaluronic acid...I'll be buying one of them in the future.",0

BURNED MY SKIN",1.0,"I've never had allergic reactions to skin care. I use CeraVe moisturizing lotion every single day, which has hyaluronic acid in it. Because of that, I didn't think to test this on my skin. I just went fully in and used it twice. My face turned red, got dry patches on it, and broke out in tiny little rash like pimples all over. That was a week ago. I've since trashed this product and have been moisturizing multiple times a day. I still can't wear makeup because of the sensitivity, but it's getting better.If you're going to try this out, test it on a small patch of skin first!",3

Really disappointing",1.0,"I purchased this product after using a much more expensive hydration serum from Rodan and Fields. I had never used a hydration serum before that, but the R&F product was too expensive for me to reorder. I like the Cerave face wash that I have used in the past, so I thought I would give this a try. What is most disappointing about it is that, instead of moisturizing at all, it left a burning sensation after use and caused my skin to peel in areas around my nose and mouth--similar to when a sunburn peels. I do have dry skin but it is not generally all that sensitive. I have used products with hyaluronic acid in the past and not had this problem. I tried the product for a week and then gave up. I will be throwing the rest away.",5

Disappointed",1.0,I wasn't sure if the other reviews about leaving a white flaky residue were correct. I thought maybe it was just other people. The first day that I used this product I didn't have that white flaky residue but the second day BAM there it was. I was not happy with that. I was very disappointed with this product.,3
