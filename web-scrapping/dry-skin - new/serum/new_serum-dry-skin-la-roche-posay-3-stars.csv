Silky & good under makeup",3,"I've been using this for a few months now. You can apply makeup on top of it and it doesn't pill. It feels a little sticky when first applied, but dries to a silky finish.As for the cons, it's a very sticky serum & ends up all over the outside of the bottle, so you have to keep wiping it off.I haven't noticed any changes in my skin, but I'll update this if I do.",0

It may work nicely - but I think I'm sensitive to hyaluronic acid products",3,"I have tried several different products, by several different brands, containing hyaluronic acid and each time I break out. So I'm not the best person to review this product - but I can tell you most likely this product does indeed contain hyaluronic acid because I broke out.",0

STRONGLY Perfumed",3,"I get it: some people like scented facial products. However, the description “lightly scented” couldn’t be more misleading. While this serum has a nice texture and applies smoothly, I can’t bear to use it because of its strong perfume. No facial benefits are worth the headache.",0

They have change the product, it is now watered down",3,"I have loved this product and purchased it for year.  It was a rich, thick serum, it made my face so moist and literally glow.  The last 2 purchases, I have noticed they have watered down the product, it is not the same at all, I don't feel the moisture, it is runny and like any serum now.Very disappointed in what they have done.",4

Love the brand, hate the scent.",3,"I just received this and was so excited to try it out as I love the brand but what in the world were they thinking with this scent?! I find it overwhelming and not particularly pleasant, it's like a room deodorizer. One reviewer said that  the smell dissipates after a little while. I don't find that happening, it's been at least 30 minutes and it's still very strong.. For someone like me that is sensitive to fragrance in products it's not something I want so I'm very disappointed. I'm not sure if I can return this but I would if it's possible.",5

Cheap ingredients, terrible over-powering smell, waste of money",3,"I only gave this 3 stars because I tend to read those first. This product is not trying to earn starts, believe me.I purchased this specifically for healing after Microneedling on the recommendation of a YouTuber who has turned me onto some great products. This was a glaring exception!It is a nice thick viscous texture like Cos de Baha hyaluronic acid serum (which is $5 an ounce) which is made from the large molecule hyaluronic acid (aka the cheap stuff). Well guess what, SO IS THIS!!No wonder they are not disclosing the ingredients in any description section or photograph: The first four are water, glycerin, ALCOHOL (EWG 4), and propylane glycol (EWG 3) so already this is sounding like a $5 serum.The only actives I see high up are Madecassoside (...aka Gotu Kola. It's soothing but it is cheap) and then what it is named for, the Dexpanthenol aka B5 which is the FIFTH ingredient after all of the cheap stuff and can be found as the main ingredient in a bunch of serums that are HALF of this price.And then, if that wasn't enough, it has a horrible, overpoweringly artificial fragrance.How on earth are people spending $50 on this over and over again?! Is it about the name? Is it the first serum they've ever tried?? This was my first La Roche-Posay product and it will most certainly be the last. Absolutely bonkers.",38

Product Not Sealed",3,"So I am giving it 3 Stars to be fair because I believe it to be a good product but it came without any seals on the box or the bottle. I read a response from the company from a few years ago that said that not all their products are sealed yet but even if that is true I am not comfortable using a product from Amazon that is not sealed when counterfeits and third party resellers are rampant.  Buying sold and shipped by Amazon is meaningless now since they comingle inventory from the manufacturer and third party resellers and you never know what you're getting.  Unfortunately, Amazon puts it on the manufacturer to enforce reselling policies and does nothing to prevent third party resellers from selling bad products in an effort to maximize efficiency coupled with no way of knowing which seller is actually filling your order makes ordering expensive health and beauty products like this a gambit. If it were cheaper I'd take the risk but for $32/fl. oz. I can't justify the risk.I will be attempting to purchase this directly from the manufacturer now.",9

very sticky",3,"The formula is very thick, sticky and sits on the surface so i don't think the ingredients are getting into my skin and probably not getting the benefits. It has a mild scent but its pleasant so it doesn't bother me. I will keep it as I already opened it but will not be purchasing this again. I have bought other items from this company (eg. sunscreen and such) and really liked the formulas and benefits but this particular item is a definite ""miss"" for me.",2

Lingering Scent",3,"This product is probably amazing, but I wish I had checked out the ""scent"" field in the description. It is, for me, very strong. Worse, it doesn't dissipate in a moment or two like other skin products. I can still smell it a half hour later, even after applying moisturizer immediately. Enough to give me a slight headache.

Disappointed",3,"This is supposedly supposed to help with ""aged"" looking skin. I can tell you after having it for over a month... I see no difference. I'm not old at all, it's just that my nose Is made up of large pores and all this does is make it look oily. The smell is fine, but not necessary.My dermatologist recommended me this and I'm very saddened... seems like I have no hope for my nose! :')However, I will say that when it's on, it does make my pores look less visible because of the oil.And by the way, people are right about the handle. You mustn't take it out because then you'd be wasting 5$ every time by getting product all over.",36

Great but smells",3,"The scent is strong af. Like while I'm applying it, it's not like hard to breathe, but it is uncomfortable. And I still smell it on my face a couple hours after. Smells like old lady. Not like nursing home old lady, but old lady perfume. Like when someone hugs you and their perfume stays on you and it's super annoying.. that. But for your face.It's a bummer, too. Bc it really is the best hy acid serum I've tried. I really wanna keep using it, but... Maybe it'll be a forehead only thing til the bottles finished idkAlso, for sensitive skin ppl, I'd imagine the perfume would aggravate the heck outta my skin if it were already irritated or overly sensitiveBut hey, for less picky ppl, it really does moisturize like a champ",2

Super moisturizing but very sticky",3,"I bought this serum with the La Roche-Posay Moisturizer 2 weeks ago. I have Rosacia, no wrinkles yet but I'm not happy with the texture of my skin. Lots of bumps and very dry. I've been using it religiously since it arrived and WOW what a difference in my skin. Even my husband says it's softer and smoother. I did add dermaplaning to my regimine too. My issues with this serum is that even after letting the serum dry for 10 minutes before applying moisturizer my face is 'tacky' or 'sticky' all day. This makes it difficult to put on foundation as it sticks in places or applies thicker in some areas.  It also seems to make my redness more prominent. It's a toss up on whether I'll reorder.",0

Why would anyone want perfume on their face???",3,"LaRoche Posay makes good products, but I will never understand their penchant for putting perfume in everything. This product goes on your face — why would anyone want perfume on their face???I use the unscented version of their European sunscreen and it’s the best I’ve used, but this serum doesn’t come in an unscented version. It’s very good if you don’t mind the perfume scent, which smells a bit grandma. Even if it were a better scent, it would still be annoying.My lady turned me on to a serum by The Ordinary which is identical in feel and effect, but is unscented and half the price.",2

Can’t get past the fragrance",3,"The product itself seems to do as promised and helps your skin retain its moisture.  The problem for me is the scent. It’s not an unpleasant smell by any means, but it is just so strong that the 4 nights I have used it, I’ve ended up with a headache.  I hoped I would get used to it, but unfortunately it is just a very cloying smell.  Admittedly, I am sensitive to fragrance, so it may be a nonissue for others. Just something to be aware of, as I was not expecting this in a product that says it’s for sensitive skin and seems completely unnecessary.  Will be returning.",2

Great product, but be wary of buying it off Amazon",3,"The product itself is great. Smells great, moisturized really well. It’s great to put on at night. However, AMAZON, the bottle was delivered outside of the box, and the cap to the bottle was cracked into pieces. While there was still a protective barrier, so none of it leaked, the suction bulb seems a little brittle, as it makes crunchy sounds when I squeeze it & it pulls very little of the product up into the dropper. I have to do it a couple of times to get enough. I’m not sure if this is normal, or the bottle is old, or Amazon is storing them in a place where rubber gets brittle. If I buy it again, I doubt it will be from Amazon.",0

Does not spread on entire face with just 3-4 drops",3,The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the directions say to use 3-4 drops. 3-4 drops does not cover the entire face as this formula does not spread well. I bought it a month ago and probably will get 2 more weeks out of it. I found if u use it while your face is a little damp it spreads better but this may just be the water spreading on my face. I was hoping it would last longer.,0

Sticky",3,"I got this on the mail yest. I have used it three times. Once when I got it (early morning, at night and this morning before work) I do like it so far. What I have noticed is when it's dry on my face, my face is still a little sticky! I do not like that Park. I also ordered the face wash so I wash my face and then use this serum, I don't like the sticky feeling, especially my neck area. Lest see if it improves some how",0

Hyaluronic Acid-Do your research",3,This product is decent. The hyaluronic acid craze is over rated. If you study the science you’ll find that it’s really not meant to be used daily. It’s a nice product to layer for special events. For me even with appropriate product layering it actually aged my skin by stealing moisture from my dermis.,4

The La Roche-Posay name brand is okay, but it isn't the best Hyaluronic Acid product I've tried. It made my face so much softer, but it gets annoying that it's so sticky. If I sweat or cry after putting it on it turns my whole face into a sticky mess that I have to wash off or I can't sleep. I like the results of the product, but I already use such a very, very thin layerer and it's just so sticky. I won't be purchasing this in the future, as there are other products like

Effective, but sticky",3,"I have used hyaluronic acid before and find it quite effective for my aging dry skin. This formulation seemed to work a bit more slowly, perhaps because of the added ingredients. I did notice a difference after several days’ use and experienced no irritation or redness with my sometimes-sensitive skin. However, I really couldn’t get past the sticky finish it left on my face.  The product seemed to form a barrier on top of my skin rather than being absorbed into it. No matter how long I waited before applying moisturizer, the results felt sticky and remained sticky all day.",0
