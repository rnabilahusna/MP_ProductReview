Good product!",5.0,"It doesn't foam up but it feels really good on the skin and gets a good amount of dirt and oil off. My skin feels very moisturized and soft after using it and it's pretty nicely sized for the price. Also, a little goes a long way—you need only use a dime-sized amount to cleanse your entire face.",8

Cleansing, Hydrating and Fragrance-Free",5.0,"I’m an older woman with dry skin and redness. CeraVe’s Hydrating Facial Cleanser is good for my sensitive skin. Once mixed with some water, it provides a nice light foam, rinses easily and does not dry out my skin. I especially like that it cleanses in one step, no repeat needed and is fragrance-free. I highly recommend this product.",3

Skincare Staple For a Reason",5.0,"I keep coming back to this unassuming cleanser every time my skin gets the winter blues. For reference:I have oily, combination, with dry patches (overusing tretinoin 0.1) skin and I love heavy skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. So I use Embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as I felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault I’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so I started switching to gentler products, taking a page from French skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better.I randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. I tried it for a few days and I HATED it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. So I did with it what I did with other hated products—I put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. But, after a year or so I decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from YouTube derms. And I decided to actually give it a try. Because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.After trying a few weeks I loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. It would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. My skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like Sahara Desert. It really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that I know my skin can use during the colder months. I never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. It soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight.The only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, I use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. I usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so I can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. I’m used to it now not lathering and I’m fine with it. You can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. I’m a convert believer!",30

CeraVe: Because My Face Deserves Better Than a Soap Opera!",5.0,"Move aside, drama-filled foamy face washes – CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is my new favorite sitcom for a clean, happy face!I've tried face cleansers that make my bathroom look like the set of a low-budget bubble bath commercial. Not anymore! CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is like the James Bond of face washes – smooth, sophisticated, and it doesn't foam up like it's auditioning for a bubble bath blockbuster.The hyaluronic acid in this cleanser is like the VIP guest at the skincare party. It hydrates my face so well; I swear my skin feels more pampered than a celebrity on a spa day. My face is so moisturized; I half expect it to start demanding its own green room.And can we talk about the non-drying formula? My face used to feel drier than a desert after some other cleansers, but CeraVe leaves it feeling more refreshed than a morning breeze. It's so gentle; I'm convinced my face is practicing self-love yoga every time I use it.The pump dispenser is the real MVP. It's so convenient; it dispenses just the right amount, no messy soap opera scenes here. My bathroom counter is now a no-drama zone, thanks to CeraVe.In conclusion, if your face is tired of the foamy fiasco and needs a non-foaming hero, CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is the blockbuster you've been waiting for. Five stars for the skincare stand-up – my face has never laughed (or glowed) so much!",3

Best face wash I’ve ever used",5.0,"I’ll start by saying I have only ever used drug store face washes, but I’ve tried just about all of them and this is by far the best brand and I will be sticking with this one for a long time! I’ve bought their moisturizer too, but high is also the best I’ve found. My skin gets dry in winter, is somewhat sensitive, and prone to  clogged pores and small breakouts. Most products seem to only help with one of these issues and make the others worse, this is the only face wash I’ve found that balances everything out and my skin looks better than it ever has. My only caveat would be to use an additional product for makeup removal, as this isn’t the best at removing makeup",0

The only face wash to use",5.0,I’ve been using this face wash for 2 plus years and it cleans great without over drying the skin but it doesn’t take eye make up all the way. Either way it cleans my face so well that I don’t mind the trade off (washing eyes with liquid soap to remove eye makeup),0

My favorite skin cleanser",5.0,You can never go wrong with Cera Ve. They have something for all skin types. This cleanser stays in my shower and I use it day and night. It leaves my skin soft and it doesn't feel tight. It doesn't foam but that's not a bad thing. It just means there are no parabens. A little goes a VERY long way. It leaves your skin feeling clean. There isn't much a scent but I didn't want to leave a one star for that. If you're looking for something with a scent this is not your product. It has no scent,3

Great cleanser",5.0,"I tried this cleanser when I was staying at my sister’s home and forgot to bring mine. I have sensitive combination skin and usually use products for oily skin. This cleanser worked surprisingly well for me, leaving my skin feeling clean but less irritated. I now alternate between this and a salicylic cleanser. If my skin feels more dry or irritated, this works best.  I like keeping it in the shower because it’s great for all over, too.",5
