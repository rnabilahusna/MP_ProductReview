Burned my skin",1.0,"I have the most sensitive and combination dry skin ever and heard really good things about this cleanser and moisturizer, so I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. Worst decision, as it burned every time I used both the cleanser and moisturizer. I thought, ‚Äòmaybe my skin is just sensitive/raw right now‚Äô, but it was literally the cleanser and moisturizer causing that! It made it so that every moisturizer I would normally use burn sooo bad and made my skin turn extremely red, and even caused my skin to darken and crack/peel. I wish this would have worked for me!üò≠ I still hear very good things, so if it works for you that is fantastic!ü•≤",0

DOES NOT REMOVE MAKEUP",1.0,"I put this facial cleanser on a wash cloth. After washing my face I wrung out the cloth and was surprised to see no makeup going down the drain from the washcloth. Then I applied toner to a cotton pad to remove anything left behind on my skin. Typically there is hardly anything that comes off on the pad after washing my face. This time the cotton pad looked dirty. It was full of the makeup that the cleanser did not remove! ""Gentle"" is fine but if it doesn't clean, it's just leaving behind dirt and makeup on the skin. This is something many people wouldn't realize unless they follow up with a toner.",3

Causes bumps",1.0,I decided to try a new face wash after using cetaphil for 10 years. This product caused my entire face to be covered in small raised bumps just after a few days of using it. The bumps were somewhat itchy. I noticed that other people who posted reviews have had similar reactions with their skin. I will be sticking with cetaphil!,0

Caused acne",1.0,Sadly after months of using this product I realized that it was the cause of my acne. I had clear skin prior to using this product. I did not realize it until my face became severely broken out. Still on the road to healing my face but it is looking better after discontinuing.,0

Does NOT remove makeup at all",1.0,How can this be effective against dirt or germs when it doesn‚Äôt even clean oil free makeup away from your skin? I‚Äôm in my 60s and I didn‚Äôt want something greasy so this for the bill- I also didn‚Äôt want something foamy to strip my skin‚Ä¶ this also fit that bill- however - I do wear makeup every day and wash my face without a washcloth ( they‚Äôre too harsh) and this felt nice. Then I would use a towel to dry my face and the makeup would show up on the towel! Causing me to have to wash it again. Looks like I‚Äôm still searching for the right product. This sure isn‚Äôt it.,4

Burns! Not for sensitive skin!",1.0,"I have tried to use two different containers of this just to make sure I didn't get a bad one the first time. I don't know what's up with this face wash but it burns my skin. Leaves it all red and irritated, feels like my face is on fire the moment it is put on. I really tried to give it a chance but it never got better and my face had never looked worse. Could be a bad batch or something but I myself wish I would have never purchased it. Switched to Vanicream instead and have had no issues.",2

Thoroughly disappointed",1.0,"I usually have no trouble with acne, but now that I‚Äôve been using this product I all of a sudden have bump after bump coming up along  with increased texture and dryness on my cheeks and nose. I have changed nothing else in my diet/routine and have been using this product for over a month now, will not be continuing!

Burning my Skin",1.0,I used this product in the UK with no issues so I don‚Äôt know if I have received a faulty product. However since ordering this after moving to the US it has been burning my skin and causing my skin to peel in places. I ordered this as my skin was dry and was looking for a gentle but moisturizing cleanser but this product has not lived up to my expectations at all. Very disappointing,0

Not as mild as it claims - read the ingredients list",1.0,"If you have a sensitivity to niacinamide then this may make you break out.I‚Äôve been working with a dermatologist to clear up adult acne after a few really bad breakouts. For the last year or so I had been using a popular online derm brand that offered me a ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù formula. It included niacinamide in it. My acne kept getting worse. After 8 months of that I went to see a real derm. Removing niacinamide seemed to help, though I didn‚Äôt know at the time that this was what was being changed.I wanted to try this face wash as it was a popular comparison to another hydrating gel face wash I‚Äôve been using (and loving). Within 3 days of getting this cleanser, my skin started freaking out. Then it got worse and almost looked like I had ripped at my skin and created open sores. I did some searching and realized it was right in front of me - niacinamide.When I stopped using the cleanser and removed all products with the offending chemical, a week later and things are starting to clear up again. It made my skin so patchy and painful that no amount of moisturizer or Vaseline could help calm my skin.Do NOT buy this if you are concerned about being sensitive to niacinamide. It‚Äôs in a lot of beauty products now, and it‚Äôs hard to know what could be harming your skin - but I do know that this cleanser really dragged back my progress.",34

Hate this cleanser",1.0,"I usually use the lipikar AP cleanser from this brand but it was out of stock for a few months so I tried this instead - it is awful lol. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it rinses clean and doesn‚Äôt do a good job of removing makeup, it feels like washing my face with lotion. It has a similar consistency to cerave hydrating cleanser (which I also hate) - I guess if you like that one this one might be good too? I just don‚Äôt like how difficult it is to rinse off.",6

NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN",1.0,"I have heard great things about this product and wanted to compare it to my other face wash. The product went on smoothly and the smell wasn‚Äôt overpowering at all. It was a light, fresh-clean like smell which I loved. I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn‚Äôt feel like it was actually cleaning my face. It felt more like I was just rubbing on some type of non-absorbing face cream. There were no suds at all (as is my typical experience with other facial cleansers) which I thought odd.However, I wasn‚Äôt able to give this product a full chance as it turns out that I am allergic to one of the ingredients. After using this product, my face felt like it was on fire and had turned a light-red color. This product was not a perfect fit for my sensitive skin and I would return it if I could. However, I have missed the return window, so now I have a full bottle of unusable product just sitting on my counter. I will be sticking with my old face wash (Vanicream).",8

Bad bottle?",1.0,"The most recent bottle of this cleanser I purchased sudses and stings my eyes in a way that this product never has before!

Worthless cleanser",1.0,"I gave this cleanser the benefit of the doubt, but it has continually failed. It is comparable to washing your face with a whipped crisco. It does not remove makeup (at All) nor does it remove facial oils. To say it‚Äôs gentle is an understatement. It‚Äôs so get it doesn‚Äôt take anything off of your face. Even a moisturizer would remove makeup, and this doesn‚Äôt even do that. I am so disappointed in the product and that I paid for something that is completely useless!!  Don‚Äôt waste your money. I have a bottle that is 3/4 full that is going in the trash.",0

Doesn't cleanse well at all, even with double cleanse.",1.0,"Didn't cause me any dryness or irritation, but the job of a cleanser is to cleanse, which it did not, at all.  Even after double washing my face with this, the cotton pad I applied toner with would be dirty.  This doesn't happen to me with other cleansers.",2

extremely irritating",1.0,"I was looking for a ""morning"" cleanser, something a little less ""heavy duty"" than the DHC cleansing oil I use in the evenings. I have somewhat reactive skin and look for products that will be gentle. I have loved this brand in the past, and use their sunscreens daily. The first wash with this, my face began to burn on contact with the cleanser, and afterward it stung for hours. I gave it three washes to try it out, and each time the same results with an increasing degree of severity. The cleanser is irritating and drying, my face felt taut, parched, and ""exposed""- anything I've put on it afterward to calm it down has also irritated (German Nivea, PTR water cream). Tried it for the third and final time last night, and then this morning went back to just water and a gentle emollient moisturizer, and my face is still blotchy, red, and painful.Don't buy this.",11

Disappointed",1.0,Heard a lot about this and it has good reviews but now I don't understand why people like it. I've only used it once and immediately it started to burn. I do not have sensitive skin and it's normal/balanced. Even worse it smells. My first thought was it smelled like the swimming pool at my gym. Gross.Maybe they made a bad batch or something but this thing is going into the trash bin.,6

This caused welts and burning.",1.0,I assumed that since this was touted for sensitive skin I could use it.

No just no",1.0,"This really messed my skin up. Right after first use I developed these risen bumps on my forehead and temples that moved to my cheeks, and now I have pimples all over my chin. I haven‚Äôt even used the product for two whole weeks. I would have stopped it sooner but I thought maybe my skin was going through a ‚Äúpurge‚Äù, but when I started to get tons of dryness with the pimples on my chin to the point my makeup was peeling off, I knew I needed to stop it. I‚Äôve never had that in my life. I don‚Äôt normally even have pimples, just one here or there.  I switched to the philosophy purity cleanser and moisturizer and my skin seems to be bouncing back, but it will take some time to repair. Guess I‚Äôll have to live under a rock till then ‚òπÔ∏è",3

This is not for sensitive dry skin",1.0,I bought from amazon.com so I know I got the legit product. And it is unbelievably drying. Every time I would wash my skin it felt like my skin was on fire. I thought maybe I was just going through a weird skin week so I stopped using it and went back to it a month later. And now again after one wash the skin on my face feels so tight like its cracking in a million places (even though I use moisturizer and a face oil right after). I believe an ingredient in this cleanser is highly irritating and causes a chemical burn on the skin. Its not for those who have dry sensitive skin!,2
