Very drying",3.0,"I love the ingredients, texture and foaming of the face wash.  My skin feels clean and does not have a tight feeling.  When I began using the product, I started out slowly, and only used it twice a week to allow my skin to adapt.  I noticed my skin being dryer than normal, which  was dissappointing because it is advertised as nourishing and non-drying.  I continued using it hoping with time my skin would adjust, and followed with a good moisturizer afterward.  This seemed to help enough that I wanted to give it a longer try.  I am sorry to say, that even though I have never been considered to have dry skin, things have not improved and this product is drying my face so much that it feels like sand paper.  I wish it would have complimented my skin better.",2

Okay product",3.0,"I had someone recommend this Facial Cleanser, and honestly, I don't feel any difference on my skin. I'm not sure if it's actually doing or changing anything for me; I see no noticeable difference. However, I am using it as a soap to clean my face. I would say I feel neutral about this product.",0

Needs improvement",3.0,"It feels like you're washing with a light lotion and it doesn't seem to rinse off without leaving a film like a lotion would.  I use a soft wash cloth to rinse it all the way off.  It's not good at taking off sunscreen or makeup.  I had used a toner after washing once and was surprised at all the dirt and makeup still left on my face.  Up until then I thought it was doing a better job at cleansing than it really was.  I basically use it on days or nights when I need something very gentle, like after a face treatment or on days my face is acting sensitive.  So, on a positive note,  it doesn't bother my sensitive skin or have any fragrance. The bottle is big and has lasted a very long time.  I use other cleansers as well so it's lasted even longer.My biggest problem with Cerave is they are not cruelty free.  I've been switching to other products because of that.",0

I also didn’t feel like it cleaned my face at all. I would recommend the foaming facial cleanser from CeraVe over this.",0

Still deciding / Overall Like",3.0,I have hormonal acne as a 36 year old and I am struggling to find the right combination of skin care products. Trying to dry these suckers out but keep my skin soft and hydrated is difficult. This is a good size for the cost and it IS moisturizing. My skin is less peely on my problem areas - chin and cheeks. It does feel weird when I get it on my lips - like a film. I am not WOWED by this but will continue to use and see.,0

I MISS THE FOAM!",3.0,"If you are ordering this particular products from cerave  like I did because the foaming wash was out don’t buy. You will definitely miss the family consistency. I bought this one because I thought it would be a great back up, but I definitely miss the foam. It feels more like you’re washing your face with lotion than actual soap. So maybe just wait until the Bowman comes back into stock.",0

Does not remove makeup",3.0,"It has a nice feel and nice ingredient list. I bought it as a drugstore alternative to more expensive cleansers recommended by a dermatologist but if you wear full coverage makeup, this isn’t the cleanser for you. I used a generous amount, massaged it thoroughly, and there was SO much makeup on my towel. I toned and used a glycolic acid after and still kept coming up with makeup. If you’re not a big makeup wearer, this could be great for you. But it did not do the job I’m used to with other cleansers. YMMV",0

Doesn't remove eyeliner :(",3.0,"This is my first time trying this brand of face wash. After reading all the good reviews I expected to be more satisfied. The consistency feels more like a watery lotion then a wash. Unfortunately it does not remove my eye makeup. My usual drugstore brand of face wash does just fine so I was disappointed that I now have to use a makeup remover too.If you have sensitive skin, and you don't wear makeup, this is probably a good product for you. It's unscented and doesn't foam up when you scrub. The large bottle is a good value for the price.",0

It feels like lotion",3.0,Did not enjoy this product. I thought it would make a bit of soapy foam but it 100% does not. Feels like lotion when I use in the shower. Now I know to purchase the foaming cleanser. But the package is huge so it’ll last forever which I’m not mad about.,0

Doesn’t really do anything",3.0,"I remember the first time I used this, a long day after school and I wanted to clean my face and relax. I used it, rubbed my fingers really well under my eyes, and put water. Nothing changed. Most of the concealer was still there. So I tried washing again, and it was still slightly there. I can tell because I have darker under eye circles and what it was after I washed was NOT it.The feeling of it:It’s thin. You put it on your face and it’s smooth and thin, and then you put water on it and it washes off right away. One swipe it’s gone (that should be the makeup, not the product itself). It shouldn’t be like that for a cleanser. I switched from La -rosche posay and I shouldn’t have. I still use this cerave cleanser since I don’t have any other one currently, and it doesn’t do anything bad to your skin, but I use African black soap after because of how ineffective it is.  It still is a cleanser though, just not as good as other ones and definitely not a good first.",2

Doesn't clean well",3.0,"I do have sensitive and reactive skin but I find this facial cleanser didn't cleanse well enough, may if you need a gentle cleanser this may be for you.  It didn't clean well enough for my combo skin. I don't mean squeaky clean, just needed something to cleanse my face in the morning or on days I don't wear any makeup or sunscreen. This cleanser left a layer on my skin which I can definitely feel. It is somewhat moisturized and best for winter but its not a cleanser I can use every day. I finished the rest and used it as hand soap.",0

Decent Face Wash",3.0,"I use this face wash twice a day, in the morning after waking up and at night before bed. This is a very lightweight facial cleanser and does a good job at cleansing my face and removing dirt, oil and makeup. The only thing is if you have acne or dark spots, this cleanser doesn't do a good job at helping to diminish or remove them. I have acne prone skin and my skin is oily on the top half and dry on the bottom half. Using this product doesn't help with my acne, and in fact I've noticed I've been developing more acne after starting using this. Not to say that this face wash has caused me to have more breakouts, but it doesn't do as good a job or removing them compared to facial cleanser meant for acne-prone skin. But this isn't suppose to help with acne, so can't be too upset with it. I will continue to use this product, as I don't want my money to go to waste. But I won't be purchasing this product again, as I need a facial cleanser that's specifically meant to help with acne, dark spots, clogged pores and hyperpigmentation.",0

Waste of money...",3.0,"First let me say, this product does not claim to be a make-up remover.  Having said that, most would think that a product that says it is a ""facial cleanser"" would mean it actually cleans your face.  Unfortunately, I cannot claim that this product cleaned my face.I am a fan of CeraVe and have been using many products from this company for the past 8 months or so.  However, this ""facial cleanser"" did not do a good job of cleaning off my liquid foundation, which means it could not have my skin.  Instead, I had to use a facial cloth to wipe off the left over make-up and washed my face with another product.I have regularly used Clean & Clear's Daily Pore Face Cleanser and it cleans just about all of my make-up, if not all of it.  I never wipe off my make-up prior to washing my face and the C&C cleanser works great!Because I do not want to receive any strikes on my account, I will not be returning this product.  I will likely have my family use it until it is gone and will not reorder.  Good luck with whatever you choose to use.",3

Not great if you use Tretinoin/it’s winter.",3.0,"First use or two I thought it was okay. But it did start to dry my skin out after that. It’s really not that great for my dry/tretinoin skin even in the summer months. Takes makeup off okay, not the best for that, even with a double cleanse. I just bought cetaphil gentle skin cleanser & my skin is more hydrated & dewy after just one use. Definitely would recommend the cetaphil over this as far as cleansers for dry skin go. But Cerave is great for pretty much anything else ☺️",2

Texture",3.0,"I didn’t like the texture it felt like I was putting on greasy lotion instead of a facial wash. It doesn’t foam at all. I like cerave, I bought this for the purpose of double cleansing. I use their acne products and I wanted to balance (tightness) my skin, and the reviews for the other foaming/hydrating washes were not good; many claims stated that both products broke their faces out. I don’t know if they were purging. The bottles noted they were for dry skin, and I have oily skin, and went for the oily skin products. I have enough acne. Enough to share with others, so I didn’t want to take that chance. The reviews I read didn’t state that they were purging or assuming they were purging. I hope this review helps someone.",0

I have been battling some kind of face issue for the last 3 months for example a tiny tiny pebble jumped out of the lawn mower and hit me in the face and it just kept getting worse and worse for the last 3-4 weeks . I'm not a teenager, I'm old and then one night when I was falling asleep  I wondered what new fresh facial hell I was going to wake up to in the morning then it hit me...all this crap started when I started to use CeraVe. So I ordered Cetaphil again and honestly, within 2 days that pebble mark started healing...I do have sensitive skin but it's usually just the drying ingredient in most products that I can't tolerate but CeraVe just isn't for me...",0

Not for Sensitive Skin",3.0,"I usually like CeraVe products but in my opinion this one missed the mark, at least for sensitive skin. Whenever I’ve tried to use this as a once daily cleanser (post-gym), my skin inevitably gets irritated and I have to stop using this. I’ve used other salicylic acid cleansers with no problem. I can use up the extra product here as a body wash; but if you have sensitive skin - I’d skip this one.",3

Maybe this just isn't the best for women with older skin?",3.0,"I had used the Paula's Choice cleanser for 10+ years.  Then they discontinued it - along with the constant price increases, I finally said enough.  My first try to replace it was this product.  I can't say I'm thrilled.  It leaves a residue on my skin.  It doesn't completely take my makeup off (and I don't wear heavy makeup).  There's nothing specifically wrong with it.  It's just not the product for my geriatric skin.",3

Used/not full",3.0,It looks like it’s not a full bottle. Not sure how much these are usually filled up but I bought the moisturizer 19 oz and the cleanser 16 oz. I weighed them both. The 19 oz came to 22 oz (to be expected considering the extra weight to account for the bottle). The 16 oz weight exactly 16 oz so I’m definitely missing some cleanser there. There was plastic wrap around it that was already ripped open too. There was no lock on the knob. I hope someone just used it and didn’t like... dirty it up on the inside or whatever by sticker their fingers in it to get some out. Gross. I payed for a new bottle. Should have received a new FULL bottle.,0

It was okay. Definitely probably good for sensitive prone skin though.",3.0,Ive had it for a while as apart of my artillery of skin care but hardly go for it bc I feel like it doesn't to much for cleansing my skin. This face wash is definitely formulated for people with more sensitive acne prone skin because it really didn't stand out as a product for me like I wanted it to. Probably wouldn't personally purchase this again but that doesn't mean someone else shouldn't try it out for themselves and see if it works for them personally!,0

Nothing special",3.0,"I purchased this product based on positive reviews but the only thing I like abt this cleanser is that it smells nurture.My skin type is mixed and it does nothing to remove the oil, I have to wait for a while  after putting this on my face just like using lotion. Then the product really activates and clean up all of the oil. It won’t be a YES for a busy person like me. I want to clean my face quickly to move on my day.",0

Don't Buy Unless You Have Extremely Dry Skin",3.0,"I was excited for this product, as I love CeraVe and their gentle skin products. However, I didn't like this face wash. It is definitely super moisturizing, and would be great for someone with extremely dry, flaky skin, but for my combination skin, I didn't like it. When I use it, my face doesn't feel clean. It feels super oily and moisturized and I don't like that. Was afraid it would clog my pores or break me out because of how oily it is, so I stopped using it.",0

Not for Combination Facial Skin",3.0,"Perhaps it's just me & my personal opinion only.  This product states it's for ""normal to dry"" skin. I've been using it for the past week daily to cleanse my face while taking a shower (versus using regular bar soap).  It feels like it adds a coating to my face versus actually cleaning my face.  I'm in my mid 50's, so was looking for a facial cleansing soap to suite my ""normal to dry"" skin. My ""normal"" face skin areas such as nose and forehead seem oily after using this product. I also dislike there is no foam action at all - - it's just a lotion with zero lather.  Having said all this - if you have 100%  dry facial skin, then this would be a GREAT product.  There is no scent what so ever.  I prefer a tad bit of scent, so reason I gave scent aspect rating 2 stars.",0

Weirdest facial cleanser I’ve bought",3.0,"Have a face burn & my normal daily soap was drying out my skin, so I needed something more moisturizing. Which to be fair, it definitely moisturizes. But it kind of lacks in the facial cleansing part. I need something to help me wash off my old meds so I can apply a fresh layer, but it doesn’t really work.

I don't get the hype",3.0,"It feels more like a light moisturizer than a face wash. It's sheer and very gentle but doesn't really lather nor gives me a refreshed feeling of clean. Most face washes I've used leave me with a squeaky-clean feeling and this just leaves me feeling meh. I bought it because a lot of people rave about it having good ingredients, gentle, moisturizing, and overall a great product. For being a drug-store item, i consider $15 for a face wash to be kind of pricey. You do get a good size volume for the item and it satisfies all of it's major claims. I just feel like for my skin, it doesn't do much for it in comparison to other brands that i've tried.",2

Partially Personal Preference",3.0,"As someone with combination oily/sensitive skin, I wanted a gentle cleanser that I could use in the evening. Since it is a hydrating cleanser, I am sure it is great for those who suffer from dry skin, but it felt completely ineffective for my skin type. I didn't notice any difference in my skin quality, and more often than not I ended up using two pumps of product (and a decent amount comes out with each pump) in order to even feel like it was cleaning my skin - to me it felt the same as using micellar water on my face. I personally like to feel as if excess oils and dirt are gone at the end of the day, and this did not quite do it for me. Do not recommend for those who have a similar skin type as I do.",7

It’s very moisturizing and cream based which I’m not used to because I like to have that tight skin feeling after I wash my face so it’s “clean” but lately my skin has been chapped and with 2 uses, I could immediately tell that it was hydrating. I AM, however, giving it 3 stars because the bottle cover wouldn’t open and then when it did, it was broken. So now I have to fix the pump every time I want to use it and that’s annoying.",0
