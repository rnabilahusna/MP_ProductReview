Doesn’t wash",1.0,"I’ve been using this product for months now. I haven’t liked it from day one but the bottle is GIGANTIC and because it’s supposedly a great product, I didn’t want to waste it. What I dislike most is that it doesn’t seem to remove sweat/grease. I get that people don’t want their skin to dry out, but when I go to the gym or hiking, etc, I need to feel like my face is clean afterwards. With this I feel like I am just spreading my own face oil around my face. I have combo skin, so mainly get oily on the forehead and nose. When I’m done washing my face, the forehead and nose still seem greasy, whereas the other areas don’t. I’ve tried using more and rubbing for a while (it doesn’t lather), but it just doesn’t seem like I’m washing my face with anything better than water. It also didn’t help with breakouts, in my opinion, because it doesn’t wash the skin very well. It most certainly doesn’t get make up off, but I don’t know if every face wash is meant to do that. With this, I definitely need to remove my make up first, but for all the people complaining about that, it’s probably because it just doesn’t wash skin, oils, anything else off very well. I still have a ton left. I might use it on days where my skin isn’t very dirty at all. Might throw it away. IDK. Every face wash I’ve tried was better than this.",7

Irritated my skin, didn’t feel clean, dried my face out",1.0,"After this brand’s lofty reputation, I had higher hopes for their products.I recently began getting contact dermatitis. Months of itch and, always while seemingly on the mend, something began to irritate my skin again.Took a month and a half but finally saw a dermatologist. He said that he believes the dermatitis is from products I’m using. He gave me a list of ingredients to avoid and suggested this brand’s big tub of moisturizer. I figured with this kind of support, it must be a good brand.Sadly, this face wash did nothing to remove the oil I get around my nose (my face didn’t feel clean) and it also left my face feeling parched- like, sitting in the desert sun for days dry. Dry like I’ve never been with any other product.The moisturizer, by the way, left a coating that felt at once greasy and sticky, but weirdly not hydrating. Like a coating. A face mask feeling, rather than moisturizing. Very odd.I think I’ll continue with their competitor, Cetaphil, and only hypoallergenic.I’ll also note that the review for this product that stated there were carcinogenic ingredients, particularly related to breast cancer, is terrifying. That should not be legal. I don’t trust this brand. I don’t like this brand.",4

STOP & READ!!!!  Seriously Amazon! You sent me a known Carcinogen!",1.0,"I ordered in September 2019 the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser 16oz. Today I'm looking to reorder this product but I was curious if anyone else was having continued dry skin like I am and so I looked at a few reviews and I came across a review that someone mentioned of the ingredients on her bottle label that she ordered here didn't match what was listed as ingredients on the advertised Amazons page.  I went and grabbed my almost empty bottle and sure enough my bottle has those 4 ingredients (on the product that delivered instead of the product advertised) that came  from Amazon. I never 2nd guessed that what I received might not be what I ordered, least of all be a Carcinogen . . . especially in women that have BREAST CANCER! I have BREAST CANCER and the labeling on the product advertised on the Amazon site did NOT have these ingredients listed on the label! So I looked today at my bottle and it HAS THOSE 4 INGREDIENTS: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, PEG-40 Stearate, Dipotassium Phosphate. On the app ""Think Dirty"", it shows these ingredients as: Carcinogenicity Tumor promoter, Documented links to BREAST CANCER, Known human carcinogen, Carcinogenic in lab studies, Hormone Disruptor and on and on! I'm on meds to keep my breast cancer from coming back and yet these ingredients, these 4 ingredients that I've been using since it delivered last September is possibly messing with that cancer prevention med! WHAT THE HECK AMAZON & CERAVE! Shame on you both! I'm sooooo disgusted/angry/disappointed right now.",0

Does NOT work for ME. Bought because it's non-foaming, but it doesn't lather, & it irritates my skin",1.0,"This is just me writing of my personal experience with the product.First off, I will say that I am not a female, but a thirty-something y.o. male with sensitive skin who has been dealing with acne since my teen years. And I've recently been struggling with a pretty bad breakout which is why I decided to buy this product when it went on sale.Now, that being said, I cannot understand how this is the bestselling facial cleanser on Amazon.But anyway... I'll just list my problems with the product.1. The product does not lather at all, it's more of a cream cleanser, so if you have acne-riddled skin like me, you probably do not want to be rubbing something all over your face; I lightly pat my face with lather when I wash, I do not rub, and this product makes it very difficult to do that.* Maybe if you're a female it would be good to remove makeup, I don't know, I'm just guessing about that, the creamy consistency and ingredients lead me to think it would, but for me, it serves no purpose as I cannot actually use it to wash my face.2. It IRRITATES my skin. I've used it three times, and each time it has burned, it's only a slight sting, but it's there.3. Because of these issues and my desire to not have to return the product, I have tried mixing a small amount of this CeraVe cleanser with a bit of another soap/body wash, I use Olay and/or Dial, hoping it would add the beneficial properties while the soap would ameliorate the negatives, namely, not lathering and being slightly irritating, but unfortunately, the CeraVe seems to basically dissolve the soap and makes the entire mixture extremely thin, with a consistency barely greater than water, so I cannot really use it for anything.All I can say is, I really wanted to like this product, thought I would based on all the positive reviews and the reputation of the company along with their product pricing, but unfortunately, it doesn't work for me and I'll have to send it back.Oh, and I give one star for scent because there is no scent, and while some people may think that's a good thing, I like my bath products to have a light/moderate scent.",17

This will DESTROY your skin",1.0,"My skin was flawless before I began using this product, I ran out of my usual face wash and decided to try something new, and since this was advertised as gentle without additives like Vitamin C or Benzoyl Peroxide, I thought this would go great with my regimen. Ever since the first day I started using it, massive red weeping postules have formed on my cheekbones and chin, along with hard raised bumps when I have NEVER had my skin in this condition in my life. I had to stop using my retinol because it burned extremely bad anytime I tried to apply after washing. Avoid this at all costs, I will be returning this bottle and expecting a full refund. This will destroy your skin.",4

Awful…formula change?",1.0,"I had this product on subscribe and save for three deliveries.  This last delivery feels like a formula change.  There’s a spot on my hairline (I’m bald) that collects oil.  This doesn’t clean it one bit anymore.  After a shower, it’s still greasy.  I feel like I rubbed lotion on my face rather than something that cleanses ANY oil off of your face.  Previously, I loved this product and other similar ones from Cerave.",0

It also made a bunch of whiteheads appear on my face which has never happened before. My fiance tried it and she agreed it was terrible. It caused her to break out and she never has breakouts.

BURNING SENSATION IN EYES!!",1.0,"I saw how highly rated this face wash was, and I decided to try it out. Throughout the last two weeks of using it, I have noticed that I had this irritation in my eyes but I didn’t put two and two together until today. This irritation only occurs at night and morning and that’s when I would wash my face. I have seen other reviews saying that this product contains really horrible chemicals for your eyes and in general, so I advise to not buy, especially if you have sensitive skin like me. I got this horrible burning and staying sensation all around my eyes and my eyelids would be really red.",0

Feels like I’m washing with lotion",1.0,"It feels like I am washing my face with lotion because it does not take off all of my makeup neither does it clean well. I usually use the foaming cleanser cerave and all I do to take my makeup off is wet my face and get a dab of cleanser and it comes off easily. However with this product I wash my face and rise 3x for 80% of my makeup to come off. Plus it doesn’t foam up and get soapy at all, it is basically lotion. I wanted to try other cerave products and I regret it, stick to what works for you.",4

It's ALL a Sham",1.0,"Starting to think the whole beauty industry is a sham. I used to wash my face with regular old soap and my skin was perfectly fine. Since finding all these face washes and beauty lotions, my skin has degenerated into a blotchy, spotty mess. After fixing it somewhat with serums and kojic acid (which isn't that good either), I started on both Cerave SA Cleanser and it's Hydrating Facial Cleanser and the moisturizer. I use them all seperately or in combination, if I feel like one isn't really picking up the slack, since it's been recommended - and neither has been doing what it's promised.I've never had sensitive skin and now it seems like everytime I wash my face, I got a new cyst, or risen or raised black mole. I NEVER had these!!! While my skin was never perfect, it was NEVER this texturized. We often get told how certain face washes have to be used because we either have sensitive skin or the chemicals are too harsh, and then you use products like these - and they make your skin worse. Then there's the opinionated comment section of people who think you're so idiotic, you can't get a simple skin care routine down. No, we can - sometimes, products are just not as good as YOU ALL make them!",18

Non-makeup remover",1.0,"So frustrated! I have been using this product in the morning when I have no make up on. It seems fine.  Tonight I used it to get all my make up off and what do you know, most of it was left on.  I have a little test I do when I try new cleansers and that is I take a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol on it and rub it all over my face to see if there’s any traces of make up that comes off. Well, this cotton ball was full of make up. Maybe i got a bad batch.  I have always used Neutrogena fresh foaming face for years, but I have been having problems finding it.  It takes every bit of make up off. I have started using Cetaphil and it does do a pretty good job.  I will be on the hunt for Neutrogena again and I plan to contact the Cerave company. The Cerave moisturizer works pretty good. Do try my little cotton ball/alcohol test.",10

Quickly oily after",1.0,I bought two of this type of the CeraVe face wash by mistake. I didn’t realize that it wasn’t the foaming soap until I began to use it but thought just give it a try.It quickly made my face look and feel oily after washing it instead of soft and clean like the Foaming CeraVe face wash I have used before. It also has a bad smell. I tried to exchange the unopened bottle for the Foaming CeraVe wash but unfortunately I was a day too late. Don’t have else to do but throw it away and lose money.,0

After using this product I did my best to not get any in my eyes but still, my eyes would burn and turn red temporarily after each use. Why would they put or allow such an ingredient in this product?it's especially annoying because the product works pretty well for the skin, just too many chemicals and the potential to cause permanent damage is absolutely unacceptable.

gross smell and made me breakout",1.0,"I had heard a lot about this on tiktok and other platforms saying that it was a lifesaver and saved their skin. I've had a long history of red, dry skin with acne. it was just starting to clear up and go to a normal color so i thought because of that I'd try this and it would help it even more but that was not the case. The first thing I noticed when I put it on my face was the smell. I can't really describe it but it smelt really strange and strong, almost chemically. The second thing I noticed was how heavy it felt, when i took my hands off my face it felt like there was a layer of grease or oil and it did not feel good. The last thing I noticed was when i was rinsing it off it made my face almost squeaky, like i was dragging my hand across glass or plastic. also the second time i used it it made my top lip burn. Idk maybe I just got a bad batch but even then they should be testing they're formulas before sending it out. I wasn't insecure of my skin for the first time in years and this ruined it. I am very upset. :(",3

Formula Change = burning skin and bad smell for this long-time user.",1.0,"I have been using Cerave Hydrating Cleanser for probably a decade. It has always been incredibly gentle on my worst days - sunburn, bad reaction to another product - gentle cleansing. It has always been scentless in the way that unscented lotions tend to be. I kicked my previous bottle and grabbed the one I had bought shipped and sold by Amazon in 3/2020. I applied it while showering as usual and immediately noticed the bad scent. It smelled fermented or sour somehow. It has been stored in a cool dark space with the rest of my cosmetics and beauty items. It also burned mildly with contact. I rinsed it as best I could and noticed my face was reddened when I left the shower. I googled furiously to find that this product was reformulated. I am so disappointed. I am uncertain which ingredient change is responsible for the awful smell or burning, but it is unacceptable. My face burned less with the use of chemical exfoliants. I included a picture of my two bottles; the new formula is on the right. I will NEVER purchase another Cerave product again. I did notice that they are no longer using parabens and are using phenoxyethanol; I am not aware of having a sensitivity to it as it is in some of my other regular products, but this should be noted for anyone who does as it's fairly common.",15

However, I did read a review where the woman stated it did not wash the makeup off her face.

I was extremely disappointed and not happy that when I washed my face and then seen all the makeup that was on my cotton pad when I used my toner afterwards.  The following day I decided to wash my face twice and then dried my face with towel only to have my towel covered with makeup.

Dries your skin out and leaves you face worse then prior using.",1.0,"I started using their Itch Relief cream in the just prior to purchasing this product...

After 3 days, my skin was irritated, red, burning, super dry, and the list goes on.  Maybe the company once was on the top of the trusted & good brands list... however, the only list this company and facial cleanser is making today, is the **** list.  You can figure out the 4 letter word that goes there... (Hint:  It begins with the letter S.)",9

Waste of money",1.0,"I work out a lot and got what some friends and TikTok said was ""amazing"" I started to use it to clean the dirt and oils off my face that didn't really have any issues. While using it I'd breakout in zits and bumps. I'm (37) and it reminded me of my teenaged years with the acne, so thanks for that. Stopped using it and my face cleared up. I just use warm water to rise and cold water to close the pours now. I don't need all these chemicals for a face wash.",7

Skin reaction.",1.0,"I'm actually quite shocked by the way this product caused my skin to react. I usually use an unscented Dove bar to cleanse my face, but it was a bit drying so I wanted to try a hydrating cleanser. I patch tested it on my arm and nothing happened, so I decided to use it properly, but when I used it on my face it turned my skin BRIGHT red, and caused minor pimples to turn into giant, red, angry welts. It took about 30 minutes from initial use for the reaction to present itself, and now I'm scrambling to calm my skin down. Not hypoallergenic!",3

Great, even if you think you have oily skin but brand is not cruelty-free",1.0,"UPDATE: I won't be buying this again since CeraVe is not cruelty-free. Look to the Ceramedx brand instead.This is a great facewash, even if you think you have oily skin, which I did. I originally started with the foaming version, which is more for oily skin, but I was getting some dryness and flaking with that version.As soon as I switched to the hydrating version, my skin in the dry areas instantly felt better and more healthy. And, I don't even notice that my oily areas on my forehead and nose are any more oily or anything like that. Bottom line, for me, the foaming cleanser version is worse, even for oily/combination skin.",0

Burning nightmare",1.0,"Ok so I really wanted to love this product because it’s one of the top recommended brands for a face wash, but unfortunately it did not work for me at all. I never considered myself to have sensitive skin until trying this. But basically it made my skin feel like it was burning my skin so badly that I was using ice cubes (multiples) just to try to stop it from burning. Needless to say I had to stop using it after that happened.So for me, this was definitely not moisturizing and i didn’t get to use it long enough to find out if it’d help my acne.Also, as far as the scent goes, I know that face wash shouldn’t necessarily smell good, but this just has an odd smell to it in general.So overall, if you have sensitive skin or a sensitive nose, I’d say read on the ingredients first and reconsider :)",4

I felt the complaints about the product not actually cleansing might by biased by people with higher standards than I.I was wrong.There is something very off with this product. It smells and feels normal, but as soon as you apply it to your face, some kind of weird oily residue seeps down- I can feel it on my lips every time. After washing away the product, there is still oil left to the touch in the t-zone (and I do not have excessively oily skin). I tried using the product multiple washes and multiple times- same effect.It’s ridiculous when you have to wash your face with *another* cleanser because this one doesn’t work.Im switching back to the regular cerave.

Dry Skin Requires Extra Moisture!",1.0,"Generally, I like this line!  However, when I used this cleanser, it stung my skin.  I thought that it might have been a fluke or a negative reaction to some makeup residue, but the second time it stung worse.  Then, after reader by the ingredients more carefully, I discovered that this cleanser contains alcohol!  Furthermore, most products which are gels, of which ch this is one, contain alcohol, which has a dehydrated by effect on skin, while the marketing often promotes the product as preferred for dry, sensitivity be skin since it glides on so easily!  I now avoid all gels, as well as any other product containing alcohol, for use on my face, neck or décolleté, and I encourage others with dry, sensitive skin of any age, to do the same.  After all, dermatologists are not perfectly knowledgeable — they “practice” medicine just like all their other colleagues!",18

To gentle to clean makeup off your face. Have to wash several times.",1.0,At first it seems very good for dry skin. Maybe it is if you don’t wear makeup. I have to wash my face twice to get makeup off even scrubbing with a not so soft bristle facial brush. After that I still have to use toner to get the rest off. This is not waterproof hard to remove makeup either. This is the worst at cleaning your skin.After two washings the facial brush still had so much makeup on it. I washed the brush with this cleanser two more times and it was still stained with make up. That never happened with other cleansers. So I went to the kitchen got out my dawn dish soap and cleaned the brush for the third time. This time it was clean with white bristles again. I believe this face wash is more like washing with moisturizing lotion. Just doesn’t clean your face.,9

I’ve now used it for a week and my face starting breaking out, which it hasn’t done in quite awhile! The soap left my skin feeling unclean, almost like it leaves a layer or film on your skin, making it feel weird and not freshly skin. It also won’t remove any makeup well, even after 4-5 washes! May work for some people but def doesn’t for me. All skin is different, but I’d caution it for users who may have sensitive skin like me.",3

Worst face wash ever",1.0,"I usually use Cetaphil facial wash but this was on sale so I decided to give it a try. Besides it was listed as Amazon's Choice. Bad mistake. I washed my face as usual, then again with my Clairasonic  facial brush. Make-up was all over my brush. I never had a problem like this with Cetaphil. I then washed my face completely twice, then used my facial brush. Same thing, make-up all over my brush. I couldn't return it because I waited too long to try it, so it was wasted money.  I wondered why it was listed as an Amazon Choice product, then went back and read the horrible reviews. I'm now back to Cetaphil facial wash and it's the best. Just sorry I couldn't return it.",5

Will not recommend anyone!",1.0,"I saw lots of reviews, positive feedback, and decided to buy. I was so motivated. But After it arrived, I was very disappointed. Does not clean make up, maybe only 20% of it. After using the product I clean my skin with Micellar Water, and then see that my makeup is not removed at all. I tried to use the product with no makeup on me, so after using the product, you even do not feeling the clean effect on your face. like you just washed your face with water and that's all.Very Very disappointed. Even will not use this product anymore, despite the fact that, it is absolutely new.",2

Terrible",1.0,This “wash” doesn’t wash anything. I had to use a micellar cleansing water afterward to get anything off.,0

Not what I was expecting",1.0,"I bought this online cause its cheaper than her where I live here in Aruba. I love this product. But this one, might be old or something but it has tiny like dirt in it that scrapes my face when using it. And no, it is not supposed to.I know CERAVE makes quality products, I don't know what went wrong but I am totally disappointed its with me.",0

It leaked but the product itself is good, just don’t buy online.",1.0,"I will say for all commenting about how it doesn’t remove your make up, do not rely on this for removing make up alone and give it a bad review. You should be applying a make up remover THEN go in and cleanse with this product. It’s not a foaming cleanser because it is meant to be a hydrating.The ONLY bad thing I have to say is the product is it definitely looks like the person who shipped it out did not care what state the bottle would come in. All the product was spilled in the box when it arrived so I won’t be purchasing this product online anymore.",0

Does not clean well",1.0,"The plus on this product is the scent, not overwhelming. The downside is it doesn’t remove makeup. After washing extremely well, using a wet cloth after,I still have makeup on my cloth when using my astringent. I also feel tight and dry. I was hoping this would be a great product, but it is useless to me. I swear by cerave moisturizer and I’m in love with it! Just not this product.",0

This is not a cleanser",1.0,"I meant to buy the foaming cleanser and got this on accident. This is not cleanser. It's lotion. It has no soap and no lather. It's terrible for washing off make up. It feels gross to wash with and completely ineffective. If you want an actual face wash, get the foaming cleanser. Not this extremely similar looking garbage.",3

Not for me!",1.0,I bought this because I was looking for a good face ash because I have really sensitive skin. And this was highly recommended and I saw it every where for like 2 months and I hadn’t heard and thing bad about it. So I got it and I kid you not after 1 use my skin broke out and my skin became more oily then normal. I wouldn’t recommend this.,0

lotion packaged in a cleaner bottle",1.0,There’s no way this is actually a cleanser. It looks and feels just like lotion and does not remove any dirt or makeup off my face. I have to go back over with micellar water to actually clean my face. I would stay away from this one!!,2

Horrible consistency and burns your face",1.0,Definitely don't recommend if you have sensitive skin. Not only with my face start burning after I put it on but using it consistently for a few days made my skin dry and patchy. The consistency is also horrific it's like lotion in the worst possible way it feels very weird and uncomfortable on your skin. I'd like to say that it got the job done but it made my skin so dry and patchy that I couldn't really notice. Overall there are better CeraVe products out there. I would avoid this one,0

Received faulty product - extremely watery texture",1.0,"This product is, unfortunately, nearly unusable due to the extremely watery texture. I can barely get my hands up to my face without all of it running off between my fingers and over the sides of my palms. I believe I received a faulty product, because I know the texture should be thicker than this. I am pregnant and don't feel safe going to the post office to mail the product back. I am hoping for a replacement so I can use this face wash normally! There was no way to contact the seller so I am leaving this review and hoping they reach out to me.",8

Doesn't remove eye makeup well at all... and, no, I don't use waterproof products.",1.0,"Doesn't remove eye makeup well at all... and, no, I don't use waterproof products. I had to rub pretty hard and that's about the worst thing you can do to the skin around your eyes. I ended up rewashing with a different product. I was swayed by the excellent reviews here, but I'll stick with Neutrogena, which actually works!",0

Not for sensitive skin",1.0,I have mild rosacea and very dry sensitive skin. Everything I saw online recommended this product in general but especially for people with sensitive skin. It made my face burn and turn slightly red! It was not a tingle or temporary burn…it just kept being hot until I washed it off. I’m sure it is a great product but sensitive skin folks beware!,0

Please don't glue the bottles to the bubble wrap. They were all sticky !",1.0,I love the product but won't buy it again because of the way it was shipped. They glued the bubblewrap  to the bottles and it was a huge sticky mess. I love the product but you need to ship it without glue or stickers.,0

This has got to be the worst thing I’ve ever bought",1.0,"This is the worst facial cleanser I have ever bought, the texture left after you rinse it off is so strange and unpleasant. It’s like a grippy film and does not feel clean at all!I’m not sure why so many people leave it good reviews.It’s as if you just washed with a water repellent lotion that stays on the skin.",0
