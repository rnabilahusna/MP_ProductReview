Great product",4.0,"I've been struggling with breakouts for a long time and ever since I've been sticking to my skin routine, I only get a lil breakout when my sister comes by every month(feels like she's been doing this all my life :)).It's a really good face wash and gets rid of dirt and oils.

Moisturizing Cleaning",4.0,"I began using this cleanser in the fall and have been very pleased with the way it leaves my face smooth and without dryness. The only problem is that washing doesn‚Äôt always remove all of my foundation when using my hands to rub my face. I suppose I could use a cloth to scrub my face, but I‚Äôm in my mid 70s and that seems harsh for aging skin. But I‚Äôve just ordered an oil cleanser to use first to remove a layer of makeup without stripping my skin and then wash it with CeraVe.",2

Helps my seb-derm",4.0,"I got this as it was recommended for seb derm and I'm tired of the flaking and itching. I haven't used it every day or regularly as I should, but it helps when I use it even just once. It kills the itch a bit and makes me feel clean and fresh faced. It's not super moisturizing as I feel pretty dry after I use it but I can't complain too much. Many moisturizers can make the flaking worse.I wish it lathered up a little but I know that lathering means next to nothing when it comes to most soaps, so it's not a big deal. Smell is very light to unnoticeable and doesn't linger so that's nice too. For the price, can't beat it!",12

Very Hydrating But Oily",4.0,"This is the best hydrating cleanser I have found for the price! It doesn't contain any fragrance and doesn't leave your skin feeling tight. I enjoy that it has hyaluronic acid plus it is approved by the national eczema association which is a hug bonus for my dry/sensitive skin. I use this cleanser in the morning for extra hydration, then I switch to another cleanser at night (CeraVe Acne Control) since I have acne prone skin, and although using it hasn't given me any acne It also hasn‚Äôt removed the previous inflammation I‚Äôve had. Basically, it keeps it at bay for the moment. With other cleansers, my skin gets dry, flaky, AND irritated. They also make me break out more frequently. However, with this product, my skin doesn‚Äôt feel dry, and I don't have problems with flakiness. It feels very hydrating with no irritation. I would recommend; however, it does tend to leave the skin oily which can be quite annoying, so apply sparingly as a little goes a long way.",16

moisturizing facial cleanser",4.0,"I've been using YTTP Superfood Facial Cleanser for a while now and have had good results from using it... but it's too expensive to be an every time purchase. So I decided to give CeraVe a try, and it's only my first time using it, but I've never experienced a moisturizing facial cleanser before...It's more moisturizing than the YTTP superfood cleanser, maybe that has to do with one being a gel and this one from CeraVe, is a...almost lotion like cleanser.My face feels very moisturized and not dried out like most facial cleansers make it feel afterwards.There's barely a scent, Im not quite sure how I would describe it...like a very soft...aloe? scent or something of that nature...but it's very subtle, you barely notice it.This cleanser also does not lather, so that might have something to do with the moisturizing qualities it provides.This is only day 1 of using this cleanser, but so far Im enjoying my experience with it and would recommend this product to anyone.",27

Feels nice but still debating it",4.0,"I got this made on multiple articles I've read about this facial cleanser. It do feel like it does do a good job cleaning my face and I like the slight tingle sensation on  my face too. There doesn't seem to be too distinct a scent which I appreciate. My issue is that the liquid is a cream like texture so that throws me off a little. It also doesn't foam like some of the other facial cleansers I've used. However, my skin does feel clean so I am going to keep trying this and will see how it turns out overall.",9

Rather difficult to describe this cleanser",4.0,"I bought this on a whim as I was running out of my usual cleanser (that i buy imported from japan), and my friend recommended to me.  I have to admit, I have mixed feelings about this cleanser.To preface, I am asian with oily skin, but I'm of the opinion that oily skin is a result of skin dehydration, so I don't mind (and in fact often use) moisturizing products for my skincare.  Here are my thoughts as an oily skin gal using this cleanser- It doesn't foam up, but has a gel-like lotiony consistency, spreads easily on face, and very gentle.- I don't think it cleans as well as my old cleanser, but it's somewhat to be expected as this is meant to be gentle and non-stripping if it's going to work for dry and sensitive skin.  however, it's not to say that it doesn't clean my face - but it doesn't give me that squeaky clean feeling- in fact, i feel like it leaves a sliiiiiiiiiiiight residue/layer on my skin, which I normally would hate but in this case it's so slight, i haven't minded it too much.  However, i really do want to note that since switching to this cleanser, the pores around my nose seems to be less clean than they used to be, which is a bummer.- the residue it leaves feels smooth and a little...silicony?  There's no silicon in the ingredients but, woah i just looked at it, got a lot of alcohols, as well as sulfate and parabens.  uh...well the good news is, it haven't done anything bad to my skin!  (note that I have not done enough research to know if the particular types of these things included are all bad or not)- despite the residue feeling, I have very sensitive skin and this have not broken me out at all, so that's a great thing.- OF NOTE, when using this it seems to...make my skin feel a little weird.  Specifically around my mouth area (not on my lips, but for example the skin between my nose and mouth), it kinda tingles/numbs/heats up.  It's not completely painful but it does get more sensitive the longer i keep this on my face.  That said, it has NOT broken me out, nor made my skin react badly afterwards.- after using, my skin does not feel stripped or dry, but i follow up with my usual toner/lotion/moisturizer anyway so it doesn't really matter.i have mixed feeling about this cleanser.  i like that it doesn't strip my skin, but I don't like that it doesn't clean as well and leaves a slight residue.  I like that the residue doesn't bother me too bad.  I don't think i like the ingredients, but i'm pretty happy that it haven't broken me out or made me more oily (which, i've tried some cleansers that really stripped my skin and made my skin feel a lot worse).  I'm not a huge fan of the consistency, but i don't hate it.  I do not like the numbing feeling, but it haven't ruined my skin either so i'm not sure its importance (there are peels/scrubs that also makes my skin burn but are obviously expected, i'm not sure if there are such ingreds in this to cause the numbing).So yeah...definitely mixed feelings on this thing lol",2

Reliable",4.0,I'd rather get the foaming cleanser over the moisturizing one for 2 reasons. The foaming one feels like it is actually affecting your skin. The other reason is that with this product you really need to purchase a moisturizing product with it. This leaves the skin a little dry but not nearly as dry as other products. The price point is a little high but this is the brand you should go to.,3

Wasn't sure if I'd like this but I love it!",4.0,"I wasn't sure if getting a face wash that was non foaming was something I'd like or not. I gave it at least a month trying it before making a review.At first I thought it felt like it left my face feeling like I hadn't gotten everything off but I've come to realize it was actually that it was washing my face without over drying it. I'm so used to feeling 'squeaky clean' after using face soaps and thought that was what I needed but I've come to appreciate the light moisturize feeling it leaves after I use it.I think I may have to use a bit more of this non foaming soap vs other brands I've used but it's great at removing makeup (I do not use any waterproof makeup so I dont have experience with this soap on those products). I don't notice any kind of scent with this wash either!Overall, I feel like my face is cleaner and my acne has improved. CeraVe is a brand that my derm has says they personally like/approve and I very much enjoy this and other products of theirs.If you've got sensitive skin or skin you feel like is getting oily because you over wash/dry it out I'd recommend giving this wash a try!!",17

Not what I expected at first...",4.0,"I originally bought this to use to remove my makeup thinking it would be emollient enough to break it down.

It doesn't provide as much slip as I was hoping,  but it is better than nothing.  I think Cetaphil has more slip. After my mascara is removed from my lashes,  I lightly tissue it off. I used to then wet my face and massage 2 pumps onto the rest of my skin. Doing this, I noticed that it was not removing my makeup if I rinsed it off and it felt like it mixed with the makeup and created a film. I would tissue this off, then do a second cleanse with a foaming wash like the Cerave foaming cleanser or Dove bar to get the residue off. What i have learned is to massage this on DRY skin.  This seems to make it more effective in removing makeup.  I am then able to rinse it off. I still do a second cleanse, but I would do this anyway because I also use my Clarsonic during this stage. On days that i don't wear makeup,  I will use just this to wash my face (I wet it with water first because I am not removing long wear makeup) and not do a second wash.  I do feel that it keeps my face soft after using it. I wish it was more smooth when massaging it onto the skin,  but I can feel that it is adding a layer of moisture/barrier on my skin.  I have oily skin, but I could definitely see this helping keep drier skin more moisturized.",0

Great cleanser but do not use for makeup removal",4.0,"Note: Cerave does not use the Restricted icon next to its name anymore so if you get a bottle without that next to the name, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an illegitimate product.  I compared to multiple bottles of the products from multiple stores, they just don‚Äôt use that icon anymore.This is a great cleanser, but it does not remove make up. I personally use it after I take my makeup off with a reusable make up remover pad, and then I use the cleanser. Occasionally though, since the make up remover pad does not remove every ounce of make up, I sometimes do you need to use a different cleanser after I take my makeup off. However, this is my number one choice for cleanser in the mornings before I put my makeup on and I absolutely love it. Just make sure your expectations of the product are realistic in that way!This product definitely leaves your skin feeling smooth, does not burn, and leaves you with a fresh canvas. I was very hesitant up the product at first because it actually feels more like a moisturizer and it doesn‚Äôt foam up, but it definitely is doing the job and my skin is doing a lot better now that I‚Äôm using this cleanser. Highly recommend, but again don‚Äôt use it for a make up removal.TL;DR:  Great product, don‚Äôt expect it to take your makeup off, perfect morning cleanser prior to makeup application.

Utility",4.0,"Here's my skin profile:Combination, acne prone skin. I use differin gel and Cerave moisturizer nightly. Other products I use regularly: salicylic acid pads, green tea toner, snail repair cream and various chemical and physical sunscreens. I do not wear make-up.This is a go-to. It cleanses my skin nicely without leaving it feeling stripped. It does not feel irritating around the eyes. It does not lather, which is something that I enjoy. The consistency is like that of a very thinand runny lotion. It is fragrance-free and it has no scent. I don't find it to be particularly hydrating per se, but it does not dry me out at all. I slightly prefer this to the Cetaphil sensitive skin cleanser, which has a similar profile and consistency to this one. This leaves my skin feeling a bit more cleansed and nurtured. I use this when I want to ""reset"" my skin and drop down to the bare basics. In my opinion, I think this is suitable for many people who consider their skin to be oily.I took off a star because this cleanser is really good for maintenance, but it doesn't really have any active ingredients to nurture or treat the skin. That's fine though; this product does what it says it will do. It cleanses the skin without irritating it and it is slightly hydrating. And that's it. It lacks a bit of pizazz but I still really enjoy this cleanser. This is a good amount for the price too.",5

Tired of dry skin after washing your face? Look no more",4.0,"I purchased this product because I was tired of my face drying out after face washes. I compared this product with the alternative Foaming Facial Cleanser prior to purchasing. I didn't purchase the foaming version because I heard that those actually cause your skin to become dry after wash.Pro:-The facewash is easy on the skin and does not foam up AT ALL. This is great for sensitive skins, but hard to get used to at first.-The pumping feature is great because I can consistently control the amount of the product every time I use it. Two pumps of the facewash are ideal for me-No artificial fragranceCon:-As I mentioned, this product does not foam up at all, and the consistency is sort of like gel/lotion. This was hard to get used to at first because it felt kind of gross. If you cannot get over the this fact then do not purchase.Overall this is a great face wash, no smell, no foam, but cleans your skin in a gentle manner. Highly recommend if you have dry or sensitive skin!",0

Seller is Very Lazy but the product is great.",4.0,"Great product and not drying to the skin. Best when used with silicone facial brush (see photo) for more clean and to exfoliate the face gently. Best to apply moisturizer afterwards for soft and super hydrated skin. 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it could clean better but I understand the product is super gentle and wants to market it as such. To add soap to the ingredients will make it not super gentle. To solve this dilemma, messaging using silicone facial brush in circular  motion is the answer.I'm disappointed with the seller because the container was made of a folded carton with no tape to secure the products (see photo). Needless to say the box was already opened when I received it. A simple tape would have secured the products but I guess that's too much work for the seller or the seller simply didn't care if the customers received the box opened or not.
