It does what it says, you just have to be consistent",5.0,"I'm finally giving this a review after using up my first bottle and I actually reordered my second one. That's how much I like it. I have sensitive skin and I hate the feeling of residual residue on my skin, especially on my face after applying anything (hence why I rarely wear make up). I'm in my early 40s and noticed that I've been getting sun spots (which I like to think are ""freckles"") on my checks which were never there before. I don't buy anything before reading reviews or doing research on it. had enough position info on it that I took the chance.Price was decent for the amount. One pump goes along way and does cover the entire face and under my chin area. Very light feel on the skin and absorbs fairly fast. No linger smell/fragrance, which is a huge plus for me! No irritation or side effects, but do note that if you exfoliate or cleanse your face too often then applying this there will be a slight burning sensation (because this did happen to me) and it does go away in a few mins. I used to use this everyday right after I shower in the evening, but I upped it to morning and evening. Remember to put on some sort of sunblock. Follow its instructions.I like the results that it's giving me. My face looks more even, toned, moisturized, and my pores seem to have diminished a little in appearance since I first used it. I don't get little dry patches on skin on my checks anymore due to the harsh water here in Houston, TX. Again, it's really based on your skin routine, how consistent you are, how well you follow its instructions, and be realistic with your expectations. Overall, I like the product very much and will continue to use it so I hope it never gets discontinued :)",180

Truly Improved texture, coloring and pore shirking-  for real!",5.0,"Wow! This stuff Rocks! It really did even out my complexion, tightened my pores and I’m not being paid to say this. Unfortunately. lol actually I hate that’s a thing because you can’t trust reviews. But mine, you can trust! I have super sensitive skin and eyes, crazy allergies and this felt lovely, and caused no issues or discomfort (because it shouldn’t). It just felt nice and I threw some moisturizer over top the next morning was a visible difference! The following week I forgot a few days but it still improved! I can’t believe it! But then I got lazier and forgot for 2 weeks and I’m back where I started. To me, that’s a huge testament to how well it works. You’ll have to keep it up but the results are worth it and it’ll make me have better self care so it’s a win : win!",106

Absolutely amazing results, not even halfway through bottle!",5.0,"When I was looking into this there were a bunch of reviews that said this stuff works if you stay consistent with it, but don’t expect a miracle cream… I don’t know I have been consistent, not even through the first bottle and I have to say this stuff is a miracle. Face looks so much clearer, and my face honestly has never felt so smooth. Almost like porcelain or smooth glass. I put it on at night time, since I shower in the morning as well I haven’t had any need for sunscreen, but it also keeps the smooth feeling on the face even after a good hot shower. I definitely think this stuff is awesome I only wish I found it sooner!",0

Where has this been?",5.0,"I have cystic acne which leaves my face horribly scarred. I needed something that would heal some of my scarring.Now, I am realistic. This is not going to cure the deeper, thicker scars from repeated offenders (recurring cysts). Nothing will, short of a deep chemical peal. This, though, it smoothed out my skin and faded most of my scarring. My face is smoother now than it has been since pre-adolescence when the cysts began. I almost can't believe it. Retinoids really are what they're cracked up to be.I couple this with vitamin C serum and nightly moisturizer. Before that, I wash my face with benzoyl peroxide and treat with a benzoyl peroxide cream when I have particular aggressive breakouts.Sounds like a lot but then going out in public without makeup on for the first in years is also a lot.",35

What a pure and simple serum!",5.0,"I usually don’t do a full face care routine because my skin can get sensitive with certain products, but I have always loved CeraVe. I love this serum because it initially had a moisturizing feel to it, but then a few minutes later is is absorbed nicely into my skin and doesn’t leave it sticky or gross. I use this serum when I roll out my face with a jade roller so if you’re looking for a good serum for that as well then I highly recommend!",4

Works well, noticed a difference",5.0,"I bought this because I did not like the lines under my eyes and Retin A is too tough on my skin.

She very quickly gave me the name of a cleanser, this retinol and of course recommended a facial sunscreenI have been using the cleanser and this retinol for maybe 3 weeks and I can honestly say I saw a big difference in just a weeks time. My pores are half the size, not nearly as clogged and my skin is so much softer than it ever had been. It literally wipes out the dryness and I could not be happier.

Works Slow, Use at Night!!! Affordable Beginner Retinol",5.0,"Love how affordable and good Cerave products are, so decided to try this as a ""dipping my toes in the water"" type of retinol product to help reduce fine lines and acne scars. After using this for a few months, here are some tips I'd like to share:- DO NOT start nightly if you've never used a retinol product before! Your skin needs time to adapt to new routines. I would recommend using once a week, then twice, etc., eventually you can use this safely every night.- It does not specify, but I DO NOT recommend using this during the day, or if you really, really want to, please use sunscreen. This is because retinols are not as effective under sunlight and it causes your skin to be more sensitive to UV light, which will cause more damage long-term.- This works pretty slow compared to other retinols. I found it to be quite mild, so don't expect your ice pick scars or enlarged pores to show any difference any time soon. You really have to create a consistent skincare routine to see change.- DO NOT stack your Vitamin C, AHA/BHA toners, and acne products with this. I made this mistake when I first started using the serum and woke up with sensitive red skin with breakouts. Now I only use Vitamin C in the mornings, apply benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid as needed when not using this serum, and tone with AHA/BHA a couple of times in the week during the day- You should still moisturize, this serum isn't a replacement for face cream. Your skin will only create more oil if it doesn't feel hydrated, so if you have oily/combo skin, find a non-greasy light moisturizer, but don't skip it!It's not a miraculous holy grail type of product, but I found that with consistency and patience, there are some visible results, so I will keep buying since it's non-prescription and not too expensive. My skin looks more smooth now, but there are still scars, so I think I will incorporate micro-needling into my regimen as well. This is a good product to add to your skincare routine, gentle enough to start using in your 20s. I wish I had known about lighter retinol products sooner - I used to think it was only for older people and that they are always harsh.",196

Great Product",5.0,"I'm a 60 year old woman who has fought breakouts since I was about 11 years old.  The product cleared up the tiny little bumps on my forehead and minimized the whitish bumps on my face created by oily pores.  I'm hoping with prolonged use they will disappear completely!Love that it has no scent and did not irritate my skin.  You will need to follow up with a morning moisturizer, but that is the only negative.  This product changed my skin routine - LOVE IT!",18

Miracle Serum",5.0,"So I had some pretty bad cystic acne over the past couple of months, but managed to get rid of it with the Differn Gel and A LOT of water. However, it left a lot of bad dark spots behind in a few areas on my face. My Vitamin C serum wasn't helping a lot, so I found this. I was hesitant despite the good reviews, and the success of the other CeraVe products I have. Despite this, I caved in, feeling pretty bad about the acne scars and dark spots left behind.Holy shirt. Just holy shirt. It worked IMMEDIATELY the next day the dark spots were already fading, and after about a week of consistent use they're almost entirely gone. I can't even see them unless I'm really looking for them. My mom was surprised to see they were pretty much all gone. I haven't been using the vitamin C serum or other products in the past week either due to dry skin, but I'm not sure if this was caused by this or the Differn gel. So it's been solely this and some of the PM moisturizer. I desperately wish I took before and after pictures of my face because it was so bad before.The only thing I would complain about is the price fluctuations. One week I was looking at it and it was 15, another 35, and when I got it, it was 20. Don't get me wrong it is beyond worth it. But I know it's going to suck when I run out, and waiting for a good deal on the price will be a pain since I try not to spend over 30 on face products. Other than that it's literally perfect! 5 stars :D!!",65

Good for combination skin",5.0,"I use this every night as part of my regular skincare routine, and it's helped so much.I originally used it as part of my morning routine, but I am a very fair skinned person and it made me super sensitive to the sun. It honestly made it look like I had the start of a sunburn after about 30 mins outside. But that's on me as it does warn about sun sensitivity.My face is oily at the forehead and very very dry at the cheeks and chin. I also still get frequent acne despite being old enough to know how to file my taxes. This has helped even out my skin so much, and seems to really help control my breakouts when I do get them.Sometimes my skin stings very slightly after using it, but it doesn't seem to dry my skin out at all. I do use a moisturizer after using this, so maybe that's helping. The smell is kind of something though. 9 times out of 10 I don't notice it at all, but when I do it definitely makes me think twice for a split second. Once I thought maybe I hadn't washed my hands after touching a wet dog, but it turned out to be the serum and not the dog. Even if I noticed the smell every time, I would still use it daily.",32

Give it time!",5.0,"Yes, it did cause my skin to purge; yes, my skin has considerably improved though! I'm about to turn 27 and my acne isn't severe, so I can attest it works for mild adult acne.My skin has never felt this soft, and even though I've only been using it for about a month, and still have enlarged pores, bumps, some pimples and hyperpigmentation, I can feel and see the difference. Some of the area in which my pores are enlarged already have patches of considerably minimized pores, so I know it's working! You've got to allow the newer skin on the deeper layers to come to the surface, it won't clear your skin in just days, it will take weeks or months!The purge left me with post-acne hyperpigmentation but I was expecting that. I'm glad it has niacinamide and licorice root extract to help with that as much as possible. The only thing I don't understand is that when I use this product, my skin produces much more oil than it normally does otherwise. It has niacinamide and it's supposed to be a slow release of retinol so I don't get it? However, even with that issue, I still have seen great results, and I exfoliate and use benzoyl peroxide in one of my cleansers to make sure I don't allow the oil it makes my skin produce overnight to really become an issue. I use my benzoyl peroxide cleanser as a mask and leave it on for a few minutes. My skin hasn't produced new blackheads while I've been doing all of this.Overall, I'm very very glad I have added this product to my skincare routine, I think it's worth giving it a try. Please moisturize after you apply this product, because it's not a moisturizer replacement at all; and remember to use sunscreen during the day.",44

love it",5.0,"I've suffered an oily T-zone with dry cheeks/chin, blotchy redness, large pores, and intermittent-to-constant acne for years with the scars to show for it. Finally got on a regimen of CeraVe SA Cleanser 1-2x/day, followed by CeraVe PM Moisturizing Lotion mixed with CeraVe Post-Acne/Skin Texture Retinol Serum (I replace the PM lotion with their AM sunscreen one if I'm spending any time outside but usually I'm a vampire). Works best if I do all 3 twice a day, but still works well with once a day use. All 3 products have a good texture without a strong scent, and the lotion and retinol serum absorb nicely.Works a charm! Best skin I've had in my life, acne breakouts are much rarer and scars are less noticeable, and I have smaller pores, more even tone, and often a dewy healthy glow I've never managed before.",36
