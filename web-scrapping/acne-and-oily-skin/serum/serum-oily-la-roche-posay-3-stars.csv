Haven't noticed a difference",3.0,"I've been using this product consistently for about three months now, but unfortunately haven't seen any noticeable difference with my pores. Combined with the product's drying effect and strong smell, it's not made for a particularly pleasant experience.This also hasn't been the worst, though, so while this product was a huge bust for me, there are plenty of other positive reviews to say this might just work for you instead.",0

They changed the product",3.0,I’ve used this product La Roche Posay Effaclar AHA serum for 10 years. They have recently discontinued the old formulation and now have the salycilic acid formula. I am so sad about this.,14

No estaba sellado!",3.0,"El producto no está sellado, ni la caja ni el frasco. Me parece raro esto, no viene lote ni fecha de espiración lo que me hace desconfiar si realmente viene de *La Roche Posay* ?.?  Más adelante actualizaré a ver si el producto funciona.",6

Possible knock off?",3.0,Totally fine product although I haven’t noticed a difference yet. My biggest concern is that my container was missing a lot number and expiration date. I am concerned this is a knock off,0

Not worth it!",3.0,"I’m not sure if this serum works. It smells extremely strong of alcohol, and dried up as you put it on your face. It also stings as I put it on. I have really sensitive skin so this may be why, but it seems really abrasive regardless. I love La Roche products, but this one is not my favorite. I’ll probably still use it because it was expensive and it’s passed the return window, but I would not repurchase this.",15

Not sure what to expect?",3.0,"I bought this stuff because I've been seeing La Roche-Posay pop up in magazines lately and the reviews are always great.  I recently started to notice the pores around my nose/on my cheeks have become more visible so I decided to give this a try.  I've been using it for about a month and have to say I have NOT seen any difference in my skin, unfortunately.  Actually, the first time I used this product, I felt a tingly/slight burning sensation and was kind of excited because it FELT like it was doing something.  But it doesn't seem to do much anymore...I'm a little disappointed :(",2

I am mid 40-ties and have oily acne prone skin and was looking to minimize pores on my nose, to decrease breakouts and to improve general appearance of my skin. I use and like Effaclair line but this addition did not make any visible difference (better nor worse). May work for others but did not work for me.",2
