Expired.",1.0,"I‚Äôve been using this product for months now and I know what the texture is. Cerave does not put expiration dates on their products so I usually check the manufacture date when I‚Äôm concerned as they stated that their products have a shelf life of 3 years. The reason I got it from Amazon in the first place is that I got one from my local Walmart and it was expired. Manufactured sometime in 2020. I was upset about that one so I got this one from Amazon. Turns out this one is even worse. Manufactured in February of 2020. That is 3 years and 8 months ago. This is supposed to be a verified seller of Cerave. Customers should not worried about buying expired products from you. I‚Äôm going try to find out if it‚Äôs safe for use after such a long time. If it‚Äôs not then I‚Äôll return it. But if you‚Äôre looking at this review wondering about buying expired products, don‚Äôt do it. Save yourself the stress. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed",7

Sensitive skin be ware.",1.0,"This is ONLY MY OPINION! After reading multiple reviews, I bought it. I have acne scars I want to get rid of and new acne all the time due to wearing a mask for 12 hours at work (stupid covid.)  Well some of the reviews on here said it gave people ‚Äúchemical burns.‚Äù So day one I used just a tiny bit, working my way up to using it on my whole face about a week later. I ended up getting a chemical burn area on my chin. Sorry, didn‚Äôt take pictures. It lasted about a week and luckily healed. I haven‚Äôt used it since. Just be cautious if you have sensitive skin. I will say, I bought Curology and it has done WONDERS for me. Look in to it.",26
