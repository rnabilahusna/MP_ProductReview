deeply hydrate the skin",5.0,"I recently tried the La Roche-Posay Hyalu B5 Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face, and it has become an essential part of my skincare routine. This serum has truly impressed me with its remarkable benefits.  Firstly, the packaging is sleek and practical, ensuring the product remains fresh and easy to dispense. The serum itself has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, making it perfect for layering with other skincare products.  One of the standout features of this serum is its formulation. It contains pure hyaluronic acid, which is renowned for its ability to deeply hydrate the skin. Upon application, I immediately felt a surge of moisture that left my skin feeling plump and refreshed.  Another noteworthy aspect of this serum is its compatibility with sensitive skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate that La Roche-Posay products are formulated with dermatological expertise and are hypoallergenic. I experienced no irritation or adverse reactions while using this serum, which is a testament to its gentle yet effective formula.",7

Great product",5.0,"I love La Roche Posay products. I don’t have breakouts like I used to specially before or after my cycle. I do use their face wash , vitamin C , retinol, B3, B5 and a few more ! I have a sensitive skin and they are gentle on my face. I have seen a lot of improvement to my skin texture and fine line and wrinkles. Consistency is a key .",10

Funciona desde la primera aplicación!!",5.0,"Tengo la cara grasosa y tengo desorden hormonal , lo que provoca tener acné, la primera vez lo use como suero nocturno, pero exageré con la cantidad y mi cara se puso roja por el ácido salicilico, pero la siguiente noche solo use el producto en el área donde está el acné, desperté por la mañana sintiendo la cara como que tenía una base de maquillaje matte , fue increíble verme la cara sin grasa, y con las espinillas pequeñas , así que le doy 5 estrella ! Recomendación usarlo solo en el área de las espinillas!",2

It’s awesome!",5.0,"This has to be one of my top investments in skincare. I can already tell a difference and it has only been a few weeks since I started using it. I do have to use a moisturizer on my neck after putting this on because my neck is more sensitive than my face. If I don,t use a moisturizer within a half hour of putting it on my neck, my  neck is so sensitive it turns red. I never use it more than once a day on my neck. Using a good moisturizer at night after use solves that issue very well for me. I can put it on my face two or three times a day. It’s awesome!",6

No lo aplico mas de 2 a 3 veces máximo por la semana ya que al ser un exfoliante el usarlo todos los días puede resecar la piel.",8

Best Clearing Serum I’ve Ever Used",5.0,"After trying many, this is the first serum that I’ve noticed has made a difference in my acne and blackheads. I struggle with hormonal cystic acne and very oily skin and I use this during the daytime (in conjunction with a prescription treatment at night) and it really does a great job at diminishing the appearance of blackheads on my nose and keeping whitehead pimples at bay. It works better than other more expensive serums and I love the combination of ingredients. It also helps to slightly mattify without feeling drying.",13

Love!",5.0,"I love Vichy and Le Roche so very much, I had freckles, still have some but I like those on my nose (I saw a French women who is a famous make up and skin care ❤ celebrity, I should know her name, however she said if you don't cover your nose and use foundation just where you need it, and a pop of powder in the nose, people won't know as it looks very natural that you have foundation on. Nice tip, it's on YouTube sorry I missed her name!) She is cool. Ok, I love this serum and I pealed a little and was reddish at first, no big deal, then my skin was very much nicer. I adore this Glycolic acid. I use it every night with Vichy retinol and moisturizer. I never really did much for my skin in college, but now I was blessed to be guided to these brands. France is always (Europe in general) never test on animals, it is against the law there. I like that. My skin never looked better, but still a process. This serum and Eva glycolic acid are my two favorite. I never dreamed that all these new to me products would work very well. Could not be happier, so obviously I would say it the cost is doable (I am happy as it hasn't always been) try it! J'adore. Thanks!",20

Works quite well - better than I expected",5.0,I have a greasy face and at the end of the day I typically have an oil-slick to wash off. This cream does a good job of matting (better than others) and I do indeed see a couple of the larger pores begin to change for the better. I did have a pore that never seemed to heal and kept pushing out endless blackheads - this has finally shrunk and looks like it's going to go away.,5

Another great La Roche-Posay product",5.0,"So far I really love this serum from La Roche-Posay. Since I've started using their products over a month ago my normally oily, acne-prone skin has completely cleared up. I've been using the serum at night after washing my face with 
La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel, 6.76-Ounce Tube
. It goes on smooth, and you really don't need a lot to spread it all over your face. I finish up with 
La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo
 and then the 
La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid  1.35-Ounces
 to moisturize.I was curious to try it once I saw it contained alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) which helps with anti-aging. I've used other products with AHA in it and I've always loved the results since it makes my skin look fresh and clear. Just remember to use sunscreen since AHA increases your skin's sensitivity to the sun.I've only been using the serum for about a week, but my skin is looking great. My pores are minimized and my skin feels incredibly smooth. It's a great finishing touch for my skin care routine.",29

Great results",5.0,"This serum has visibly improved my sensitive skin in a short time in terms of tone, clarity, and general glow of health. I was able to see a difference within the first 7-10 days and it keeps getting better.I am now on my third bottle and cannot foresee a time when this wouldn't be an important part of my daily skin ritual.I was concerned at first that it might be drying,just because the formula does not have moisturizing properties like some serums, but this is not the case.  I have used it without moisturizer with no drying effect. I generally do use a moisturizer over it, because my skin is quite dry.I recommend it to anyone who wants a smoother, fresher,clear poreless looking skin. It is one of the great products that really work, in fact I am pleased with all La Roche Posay products I have tried.",8

A Must Have for Combo Skin plus Adult Acne Breakouts!",5.0,"I love love love this product! It has amazing results! I live in a humid climate, work out a lot, and enjoy wearing make up...BUT have annoying adult acne breakouts and dry patches! This product has been significantly minimizing pores, shedding off dry skin, and pushing acne out leaving beautiful smooth skin.Don't be alarmed if the first application might cause a mild burning sensation as it seeps deep into the skin. I never saw any redness or anything alarming. I now notice the sensation during application only after a hot shower or a work out. Depending on how oily or dry my skin is I sometimes follow the nighttime application with a moisturizer. The morning application is always followed after it is dried with a sunscreen! And I never apply it close to my eyes.Enjoy!",13

I have bad sun damage on my cheeks and forehead as well as frequent breakouts. I am 43 so I also have some minor frown lines on my forehead and the angry ""11"" between my eyebrows. Since I started using this serum, I was pleased to see my sun damage spots started to fade within a matter of a few days. My fiance even noticed! I use it in the morning and at night everyday and have been noticing that my wrinkles are much better and keep improving. I also experienced less breakouts and when I do have one, it never gets to full strength. This serum seems to keep the pimples from getting noticeable.

One of the most awesome skincare products!",5.0,"I have been using this product for about 6 years and love it. It blends well under makeup, no pilling, and is great for acne-prone aging skin. I do receive compliments on my skin often (I'm 49) and attribute this little vial to most of it. I continue to use my other faves like Osmosis, but, this is a perfect staple, especially for these summer months when my skin seems extra oily.",12

effective serum for oily skin",5.0,"I have oily skin, occasional acne on chin, and the beginning of fine lines. (I am in my mid-30's.)When I looked for a serum, I wanted a formula that was exfoilating and light weight. I decided to buy the entire Effaclar line from La-Roche-Posay. I LOVE the product!! The AHA keeps my pores clear and face smooth. I use the Anthelios SX Daily Moisturizing Cream SPF 15 with Mexoryl SX for daytime & Toleriane moisturizer at bedtime.Use caution when starting to use this serum. The AHA is strong, so you need to see how your skin will react. Test your tolerance level and work up slowly. Do not use on irritated/chapped skin. Sunscreen is a must!",6

Get it!",5.0,"I already use the face wash, toner and bb cream from this line so I HAD to try this.  I had the same tingling burning sensation as others.  I feel like I saw a difference in my pores after the first use!!! It's now been about 3 weeks and sometimes I mix this with a bit of the bb cream in the am and it's awesome.  I def recommend I feel like my skin has gotten tighter, pores are less open and I hardly use any product so this product (despite the price) should last a long time!!Will def buy again!!",5
