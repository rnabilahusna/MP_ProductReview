Looks kinda oily but love CERAVE",4.0,"This resurfacing Retinol product from CreaVe just kinda looks like melted animal fat to me kinda like collagen or something. It's pretty oily in my opinion. It's kinda clear ish white in color. It's got a creamy sticky and oily texture. It does absorb quickly.  It comes in a 1oz (30ML) bottle and is gentle so if you're a first time retinol user this would be perfect for you! Retinol helps even skin tone, helps to fade any appearance of post-acne marks, shrinks enlarged or clogged pores, and just gives you a more refined complexion while helping restore your skins natural protective barrier.",41

Good product but did not do what I was hoping for",4.0,"It‚Äôs a good product, but not for what J was hoping for. I originally bought it because I heard that Vitamin C as well has retinol helps get rid of acne scars. My main problem with my acne scars is the color more than the texture. I had been using the ROC‚Äôs vitamin C serum before this and it worked WONDERS but I ran out of the sample size so I looked into this product because if you know about ROC, it‚Äôs that their products are EXPENSIVE HOLLY COW. Amazing for the skin but I am NOT paying $49.99 for a 1 oz bottle. So I turned to this product instead. It does not help with the pigmentation of the scars but it helps with skin texture by promoting the growth of new skin cells. I would recommend it if you wanted to smooth out your skin texture, but not for something like hyper pigmentation. I also noticed that I got some slight peeling at the apples of my checks when wearing this product but I think it might have been from putting too much product on. I‚Äôve also known that if you put too much of the serum on is that it will start to slightly burn your face and make it slightly irritated. It‚Äôs is also advised tk wear sunscreen with this product as well (I think it‚Äôs because it can make the skin more sensitive). But all in all, it‚Äôs a good product, it‚Äôs lightweight, smooth, not sticky, and it helps moisturize. I can also tell that it will last a long time because a little goes a long way, I would say that I use a little under a pump each time I use it.",70

A retinol for sensitive skin",4.0,"If your skin is too sensitive for retinol you should try this. Apparently jumping right in using a retinol cream every night was a bad idea. My skin rebelled and I screwed up the moisture barrier. So I put that cream aside, rebalanced my skin by being extra gentle and tried this serum. 1 my skin is sensitive, 2 my skin is normally on the drier side. 3 I occasionally get pimples along my jaw line during my period.When I was half way through this bottle I noticed my pores looked more clear and less clogged which gave them the appearance of being smaller, which they don't get smaller just less noticable. I suffer from massively clogged pores specifically on my nose. They always looked dirty. They were less so now. I didn't experience any dryness or irritation. If you do I suggest using a hyaluronic acid serum before this one and giving it time to soak in. I've done that here and there on drier skin days. By the end of the bottle I noticed some unevenness in skin texture was smoothing out and darker scars from acne were ever so slightly lightening up.I have a bad habit of not giving products enough time to work and moving on bc I want instant results, yeah not smart. Because this is a much gentler form of retinol it will take longer to see full results but I've already started using my second bottle and that wonderful horizontal worry line on my forehead is ever so slowly becoming less noticable.Bc of how sensitive my skin is I was afraid I would never be able to use a retinol product bc I've tried many with disastrous results even when I used them once or twice a week.CeraVe knows how to take care of skin, they know how to create products that work effectively for all skin types without damaging your skin in the process. You just need to figure out what YOUR skin needs and check out their line of products. I didn't notice any particular scent but as far as I know they do not add fragrance to any of their products which I appreciate bc my skin does not like fragrance even if my nose does.When I run out of this product I will be repurchasing and I use this in conjunction with the CeraVe Skin Renewing Night cream or the original CeraVe moisturizing cream at night if my skin is particularly dry.My skin, at 33 looks better now than 5 years ago bc I'm making an effort to take care of it. I wish I had back as a teenager but maybe anybody reading this will think about taking care of it better bc it's never too late to start. Last thing, I always wear a sunscreen during the day. I'm not a foundation fan but I love the CeraVe tinted sunscreen. It offers the right tint to even out my complexion while still protecting. It's on the moisturizing side so give it a few minutes to soak in or use a little setting powder and your good to go.Also, the tinted sunscreen is not great for darker skin people, I'm pretty pale, so if CeraVe could expand that line to include a larger range of skin tones that would be so helpful.",19

Be very careful with sensitive skin!",4.0,"I (F23), and everyone else, wanted to start using retinol to help improve fine lines, pore appearance, sun damage, etc. I like this product because the concentration is low, it's very affordable, and it's less harsh than other brands.I started out using this once per week, and a month or so later went to it every 4ish days. BIG mistake lol.I don't have dry or oily skin, but my skin is sensitive. I started getting very dry all around my jaw and forehead. I stopped using it for a couple of weeks to try to repair my skin barrier, and the dryness persisted for about a month even when I was using it only every 2.5 weeks and using very moisturizing products in between. I've heard that peeling/purging is inevitable and unavoidable but I don't know to what extent. I also felt like I saw an increase in acne around my jaw for that same month, but maybe it was hormonal. It's impossible to tell.Overall I still use this product and like it, but I wouldn't consider it moisturizing, and I personally have to use it sparingly. Work your way up slowly to using it more often. I haven't seen a ton of improvement in my fine lines or dark spots, but I haven't been able to use it consistently yet either.",24

Like but need to keep using",4.0,"Definitely will need to keep using to see more results. But From what I have seen in the morning when I use it at night definitely gets rid of a lot of the redness, and the majority of the texture that keeps appearing on my face.

Quality skincare for the low maintenance person",4.0,"I am not big on skincare and using a bunch of different products on my skin and hair, but I was frustrated to still be having breakouts in my mid 30s. I was really skeptical based on the reviewers who said they saw results in a couple days...that seemed unrealistic and it wasn't true in my experience. My breakouts were just as bad in the couple weeks after I started using it, but then slowly my skin cleared up and after a month of use, I no longer have the ever-present dots on my chin and jawline. I still have some minor redness on my cheeks, but my pores seem a bit tighter and less clogged and I hope to see more improvement with continued use. I put this on daily after I shower, wait a minute, then put on a CeraVe moisturizer. It's easy to apply (I use only 1 pump and spread it pretty thin) and doesn't add too much time to my routine, which for me is key to making it a habit. I'm happy this has finally helped me clear up my breakouts, and came back to Amazon to add it to my Subscribe and Save list, only to see that it's no longer available...I'm really hoping this is temporary so I can get it in my monthly deliveries.",45

Worked.. kinda",4.0,It worked and helped with *FADING* my post acne hyperpigmentation scars they never went away but it made them look at the very least more attractive and my skin looked better on cam but as soon as it ran out and i stopped using it for a few days the spots reverted so yes i would recommend this product but buy a few so you don‚Äôt run out or you can avoid it completely and find something better but with my personal experience everything that claims to do this takes more than one bottle to completely remove even small spots,6

pretty good",4.0,"Can't say I've seen dramatic results after using pretty consistently for about 2 months, but overall skin texture and tone has improved and I'm no longer experiencing the occasional hormonal breakouts I used to... doesn't seem to have a huge effect on more significant wrinkles so far but it feels moisturizing without being oily/greasy and smells nice. As with most retinol products there was about a 2 week purging phase (increased breakouts, but no real irritation/burning) while my skin adjusted, but haven't experience ANY breakouts since.

Good Retinol Starter!",4.0,If your looking for a retinol serum without too much acidity to the skin this product provides a moderate burn and decent moisturization. Be sure to apply sunscreen to protect your skin when applying this product as it does make it sensitive. The scent itself is a hygienic smell my only criticism is the length that the moisture lasts so you‚Äôll need a moisturizer ready when applying this.,3

Stick with it and you‚Äôll see a difference",4.0,"I‚Äôm 35 and have really finicky combination skin that often breaks out and gets flaky, irritated areas. I also have patches of Keratosis Polaris on my cheeks which have been there my whole life. I tried this serum and and first felt like it did nothing for me. I stuck with it, however, and after a month started to notice a change in skin texture. After two months, the little bumps on my forehead were almost completely gone and my skin felt much softer. After three months, I noticed that my KP was all smoothed out and my post acne marks were fading. I‚Äôve been using the product for over six months now, and while I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a miracle cream, it has really helped to improve the overall texture and clarity of my skin. I have it on auto delivery now so that I don‚Äôt run out, and one bottle lasts me a little over a month using one pump morning and night.",0

Very good product",4.0,I love this product- it has helped my skin look so fresh and radiant- been using for about a month and I can tell my dark spots have much improved.

I've been using it every night for about a month and I have noticed no real change in my post-acne marks. Some are fading slightly, but I'm just not seeing much results in clearing up the post-acne hyperpigmentation.My skin is much smoother, though and I didn't suffer from any purging, which was one of my big concerns.

Feels good on my skin!",4.0,"I purchased this product because I wanted to minimize pores and dark spots that I have due to acne, specifically around my forehead. I applied this product yesterday and my skin did not show any signs of irritation. I first cleansed my skin and applied Cerave moisturizing cream on to my damped skin and let it dry (I don't think this product is meant to be applied on wet skin). After my skin dried, I applied this product on my face avoiding areas around my eyes and mouth. I actually like the product but I don't know if it's effective so, that's why I gave it a 4/5 stars. I will come back and update if I see any results. Also, if you're using this product make sure you are applying sunscreen in the mornings because failing to do so will not help with reducing or getting rid of dark spots.",2
