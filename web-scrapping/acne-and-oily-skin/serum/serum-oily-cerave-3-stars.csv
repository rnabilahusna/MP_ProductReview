Be cautious.  Eyes could swell and burn.",3.0,This stuff worked good but it made my eyes burn like fire.  I did not get it into my eyes but putting it on my face made my eyes swell and burn.  I had trouble after I took it off because my eyes watered so bad.  So just be cautious if you are allergic to anything this will affect ones eyes.  After I stopped using it on my face my eyes are fine so that is how I knew it was this product.  The product seems to work fine and I cannot tell any results since I only used it for 3 days.  Nothing else bothered me and it did not burn or irritate my skin but only my eyes watered and burned and this stuff was not above my upper jaw or around my eyes.  Something in it is eye irritating.  The price and the product must be good but anyone who has allergies needs to please be careful. This is only the second product in my lifetime that has burned my eyes like this.  Wish I could have used it long enough to see good results.,16

okay product",3.0,"I recently tried out the CeraVe Retinol Serum for Post-Acne Marks and Skin Texture, and I have to say, I wasn't very impressed. While I had high hopes for this product, it fell short of my expectations.First of all, the texture of the serum itself was quite thick and left my skin feeling somewhat greasy. It didn't absorb well, which made me feel like I had a layer of product sitting on my skin throughout the day. I was hoping for a more lightweight and fast-absorbing formula.As for its effects on post-acne marks and skin texture, I didn't notice any significant improvement during the time I used this serum. I understand that results may vary from person to person, but I expected at least some noticeable changes after consistent use.Additionally, I experienced some irritation and redness after using this product, even though I followed the instructions carefully and applied sunscreen during the day. This made me hesitant to continue using it, as it seemed to be doing more harm than good for my skin.In terms of pore-refining properties, I didn't see any visible difference in the size or appearance of my pores after using this serum for several weeks.Overall, the CeraVe Retinol Serum for Post-Acne Marks and Skin Texture was a bit of a disappointment for me. It didn't live up to its claims, and the texture and potential for irritation were major drawbacks. I'll be looking for other products to address my skincare concerns.",8

It’s not a miracle worker",3.0,So I had this product for at least 10 days now. And I haven’t seen any results of fading my old acne marks I have a few tiny scars nothing serious but I figured why not give this a try I love how it does make my skin feel after I cleanse and I put this on it doesn’t make my skin feel oily tacky or sticky. But I will continue using this and hopefully in the near future I will see better results and most likely will re-purchase again.,0

Something changed",3.0,My first order was great (second pic blue top). The serum I received this time (1st pic) was a different formula and an unpleasant smell. The bottle was slightly different and the box did say “new”. Either way the first one didn’t have a bad odor and I’m not taking any risk bc I have rosacea.,0

I am not seeing great results",3.0,"I love the Cerave moisturizing cream brand.  So I tried this serum.  This serum goes on nicely, doesn't have any odor, and is creamy. I am 64 and I have some larger pores on my chin that I would like to be less visible.  I am not seeing great results in poor minimizing.  Maybe a tiny bit when I first apply it but it doesn't last.  I have used it for a month.  Maybe I need to use it over a longer period of time.  I will update this review if I get better results.

Neutral",3.0,Good price. Good packaging. Gentle on skin. My skin is sensitive and I didn’t have a bad reaction at all. It has kept my skin soft and moisturized. I purchased to help reduce the size and appears of stubborn blackheads. I’ve been using every day twice a day for about a month and havent seen the results that I am looking for for that specific skin care goal.I will continue to use for another 3 months or so to see if this product improves my blackheads because I like the ingredients and the price is good and sometimes products like these need time to get the best results.I will update review with any changes,0

It’s EHHHH",3.0,"I have millium on my forehead and cheeksIt got rid of most of it on my cheeks in within afew weeks, about a month, but it also made me purge very badly. I let it ride out for a while but I soon realized when the pimples weren’t coming to the surface, it was just my cystic acne coming back.The millium on my forehead never went away. Right when I stopped using it my skin began to heal. I’d say this product helped give my skin that push it needed, but I’m not too sure if it was worth it.It did help with my skin tone but what’s the point if I’m going to be getting more acne therefore more scars.I’d say it’s good for some people but not for everyone.My skin is combo, acne prone, and sensitive",2

Nothing happened",3.0,"This is indeed for sensitive skin! Another reviewer mentioned that there was no percentage of Retinol in this serum, meaning the amount could be so small, there's no sense in adding the percentage. They seem to be right.I don't believe I have sensitive skin, so this was too weak for me to get results. I don't recommend it, but I did use this with another retinol serum and together, they had enough power to make a difference in my skin. I only tried this a few times, but it showed me that the amount is too weak for anyone without sensitive skin. Do consider getting a different product if that's the case.On the other hand, my skin was not damaged in any way from using this sole product, so that's great!",0

hard to tell",3.0,honestly i’ve been using this for several months and you definitely purge in the beginning. my breakouts are mostly on my forehead and in between my eyebrows but i usually put this on my whole face 1-2 times a week. i haven’t noticed a massive difference although my skin is smoother on my cheeks and chin. i’m gonna keep using it just to see if it will clear my forehead but it’s not that expensive so i would buy it if you don’t mind breaking out for a month or 2,0

I can't tell if it does anything",3.0,"Sooooo...I have no idea if this does anything. It does have a great consistency, goes on smooth, and doesn't leave my skin feeling like it's got some sort of residue on it.

Not impressed",3.0,"I've been using this for approximately two weeks, and so far I'm not blown away or even particularly impressed. Not that it's not doing something, but it's no more effective than other retinol serums that I've used. I was expecting more because 1) it's Cerave and 2) it's got additional ingredients that most retinol serums don't have. But I've noticed no difference in results between this and my previous serum.The deciding factor in my concluding that I probably won't buy this again is the container size. It's only one ounce. Granted, that's the same size as most face serums. However, given the thicker consistency of this, you automatically use more because it doesn't spread as thinly or easily as a liquid serum. And with other serums, when they start running out, you can remove the top and get the very last drop. This Cerave serum comes in a container that won't let you remove the top. That means once it starts sputtering, you won't be able to get any more product even if there undoubtedly is some remaining inside. So ultimately, with this Cerave retinol serum, you get less product for a similar price.",16

burning and peeling?",3.0,I have dry sensitive skin WITH acne so I was hoping this would smooth my skin and moisturize it... I used it daily after washing my face with the new dry skin cream to foam wash and it made my skin start peeling and becoming ashy and burn and it wouldn't stop for days after I stopped using the product. It basically looked like my face was extremely sunburned. I'm mixed so it doesn't make sense to look sunburned. Anyways if u have dry sensitive skin be careful and start with using it like 2 times a week.,3

I was also hoping it would help reduce the appearance of my large pores around my nose but it hasn't seemed to do that, either. Perhaps my skin is a little more even but I didn't find it very effective for pores or acne. I do love CeraVe as a brand and the acne facewash I bought with this is some goood stuff. This certainly might work for you and it didn't break me out, give me any kind of reaction, or anything like that. I use it up but I think I need something stronger when I run out.",0

For sensitive skin - Not much difference",3.0,"I purchased this product in October and have been consistently using it on a daily basis along with pure Rosehip oil. To start off, the size of the product is relatively small and isn't lasting. On the other hand, the product is moisturizing and gets easily absorbed into the skin, but I still followed up with a thicker moisturizer to hydrate my skin due to the thinner consistency of the serum. The product has helped my skin look smoother over time. However, I have not seen any difference in my post acne scars, in the appearance of my pores, or in the overall texture of my skin. That being said, this product would be suited for those who have sensitive skin as it was gentle and did not cause any reactions.",0

So I got this for post acne marks & it started looking a little better, but my face started breaking out like crazy. Bumps in places on my face that I haven’t had a bump on in months. So it got frustrating and almost defeated the purpose because it was causing more acne that’ll leave more scarring. I wished it didn’t cause acne on me because I think it would really have helped some. It may just be purging, but so hard to deal with when I’ve finally just got over the hump of horrible acne.I do have combination & acne-prone skin.
