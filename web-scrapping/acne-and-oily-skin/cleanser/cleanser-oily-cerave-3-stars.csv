Not for me",3.0,"I really like CeraVe products. This one isnt my favorite though. When you wash you dont get that clean skin surface feeling. It's a kind of oily feeling I dont like. Sorry Cerave, maybe Im drying my skin out to want the kind of soap that has good rinseability, but I just dont care, I dont like oily on my skin. My goat's milk bar soap works so much better - for me.",0

It's decent but there are better cleansers for cheaper prices",3.0,"I been using this cleanser for a few months now,it does indeed take all my oil, but it really doesn't help that much, I prefer INISFREE, la Roche posay, Corxs, and THE FACE SHOP cleansers, as they work better, especially Corxs oily skin cleanser as it's only $10 and works well. And thebla Roche posay is good and for a similar price as the CeraVe.",0

Wasn’t sealed",3.0,"Pro: great product and fantastic for oily skin prone to acne. Great price for what you’re getting (that is it half the bottle doesn’t spill in transit ;)Con: It wasn’t sealed and to make it worse was placed in the same box as a book I ordered.But for the purposes of this review, I’d say please seal at least the top or place inside a bag because my first order was sealed so not sure what’s going on. It can potentially ruin other items or can just generally be a waste.",0

Meant for REALLY OILY SKIN",3.0,"I would start off in saying this version of CeraVe does have a foam soapy mixture that is good for lathering up facial washes. Did notice at first seemed to have need to wash my face sometimes twice to get a full clean wash but this face wash at times was really drying even when only using once. Making the face skin few dry and need for a thirst of moisturizer. Thinking I needed this CeraVe product meant for normal to oily skin, thought I always had oily skin must be I have a mixture in areas of the face/certain area, with possibly meaning I only get oily after a long day of not washing the face or two. Thinking I might just have normal give or take moisturizer in the face.So I then mostly stopped using it for facial washes in the (morning or) afternoon and only tried using it during a shower; in which it did help immensely, with helping stop that over dry feel somehow while feeling and doing a great job in cleaning the facial area.Comparing this to the CeraVe version of normal to dry skin; this one was easier to do with being a soapy mixture keeping the face clean but times to drying. Going to switch back to the other normal to dry version. Along with this oily version of CeraVe facial cleaner seemed to work only in shower usage; so could just use other version in showers to fully clean and not over-dry my facial face.So overall, this is an okay 3/5 star, having like no scent if you care, least not strong. Yet if asking for sensitive skin... nope; meant for really, really oily type of skin throughout and must get used to how much someone needs to use the product to fully wash their face with along with a most likely need to moisturize afterwards possibly. Would recommend using it only in a shower facial wash method to fully clean a face.",2

just a cheap cleanser, nothing special",3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. And I have tried so many because I have skin that's very hard to find good cleansers for. I'm an adult, with normal/very oily skin area prone to clogged pores and acne, no matter what. My daily cleanser is important. Everyone raves about this as some amazing cheap alternative to an expensive cleanser so I decided to try it. It didn't irritate my skin, but it dried it out. I already use a moisturizer so I didn't care as much about that. However, it didn't do much for bacteria and clogged pores with or without wearing makeup all day. It felt clean but even after my normal routine with make up removal, cleanse, tone, and moisturizer, plus my weekly mask and scrub, I suddenly started breaking out all over my face, even my neck, due to what was a clearly clogged pore issue. For anyone who struggles with pore problems or acne, don't use this. It's a surface clean only. And it will vary depending in your skin type.",0

Cystic Pimples that hurt",3.0,"I am so sad that this product did not work for me.  I have used the foaming facial cleanser every night religiously for 2 months and for some reason I have been getting cystic acne that hurts to touch on my face and shoulders.  I bought this product after reading the positive reviews because I needed something to fight occasional adult acne on my shoulders & face.  I rated 5 stars for moisture, sensitive skin, and scent because this may work for some people.  I am an African American female w sensitive dry to oily skin.  My 1st cystic acne facial break out consisted of one large cyst pimple between my eyebrow and  eye lid ( it took 1 month to disappear) and two cyst pimples on my cheeks, I was so embarrassed.  I know now that it was the continued use of the Cerave that caused this because I just had another cystic pimple breakout.  Once I stopped using and went back to nuetrogena my pimples are shrinking and less sore.  I would say to try maybe a small bottle instead of following my footsetps by ordering the large bottle.",5

Works well, no off-putting scent, but I'm not happy with the ingredients",3.0,"I like this cleanser but don't think I'll buy it again.  I would be a repeat customer based on the way it works, the lack of any off-putting scent, price, etc., but what bothers me is the safety rating given it by the Environmental Working Group.  On their system a ""0"" means (as I understand it) that a product has no ingredients with any unhealthy aspects, whether it's allergens, carcinogens, etc., to a ""10"" which basically advises running in the opposite direction as quickly as possible.  This CeraVa cleanser earns a rating of ""4"" by the Environmental Working Group, a number high enough to be a concern for me.  They show it as having no carcinogenic properties, but note other concerns.  Their summary is:""Other HIGH concerns: Endocrine disruption, Contamination concerns, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Persistence and bioaccumulation; Other MODERATE concerns: Biochemical or cellular level changes, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive); Other LOW concerns: Enhanced skin absorption, Data gaps, Ecotoxicology.""Some of that might appear scarier at first glance than it does upon looking further (although I'm certainly not an expert on this stuff), e.g., re. ""irritation,"" not many soaps don't cause eye irritation, right?  That said, and although consumers need to make evaluations based on their own views, I'm not one to ignore the EWG.  That's why I'm unlikely to buy this cleanser again.In other words, I'd love this stuff if it had a better hazard rating, but given the score of 4 I think much less highly of it.",3

Was not great for combination skin",3.0,"I’m a male with combination skin (Oily-T, normal/dry cheeks). I wanted to like this product but my face did not react well to it. I gave it several tries and every time it left my face tight, dry, and peeling. I switched to Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and my skin has been much happier.While my face can’t handle this product I have been using it on my ears and neck to use it up. It’s actually very good at cleaning the oily areas behind and in my ears—so I’m glad it has some good use. I’m guessing this product is really great if you have very oily skin, if you have combination-oily be careful and only use it on the oily areas.",3

Order if skin is VERY OILY. Too drying for regular skin or dry combo skin.",3.0,"I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks now. It controls the oil on my forehead and t-zone extremely well ALL day. There is no scent,  so I would feel comfortable recommending this cleanser to someone who is sensitive to scented products. However, I have developed a dry patch along my lower jawline since using this product. I combat this with a heavier moisturizer along my jawline and that does it for me, but because of that, I wouldn't recommend for someone with sensitive skin or skin prone to breakouts, as I feel it might exacerbate any dryness. I also would not recommend for someone with dry/oily combination skin. Cleanser does not dry out any other portions of my face.",2

I want to love this and keep using it but I don't know if I can work around the side effects.Also, I wax my eyebrows every two weeks and this is my two week mark with CeraVe and it ripped skin off!!! It's so bad. :(I do kind of like the way my skin has kind of cleared up but it hurts to rub my eyes, my skin is just super thin now....you decide! I'm surprised no one has talked about the flushing, itching or anything like that. Maybe it's just me! :(",19

Great overall, but much more drying than expecting.",3.0,"Coming from the non-foaming variant, this turned out to be a bit more drying than expected. I switched from the non-foaming one because it felt more like smearing lotion instead of a cleanser. This product is fine though. It does NOT foam out of the bottle, but rather when it starts getting rubbed into your wet face. Overall it gets the job done! I've only used it once, so let's  see how my skin reacts. Will update if needed.",0

Don’t use if you don’t have an oily skin type.",3.0,"I’ve seen everywhere that CeraVe products are dermatologist recommended. However, make sure you know what type your skin is because your face might feel very tight and dry if you don’t have oily skin. I have hormonal acne and my skin is normal to oily. Most times my T zone gets oily. I bought this cleaner as it says it’s for normal to oily skin, however, after washing my face my skin felt very tight and dry and uncomfortable.

Massive break out, possibly due to other unrelated variables though...",3.0,"Without use of toner and facial lotion, this really dries out areas of my face, which I suppose shows that it's pretty effective in cleansing but I have also experienced multiple acne break outs on my cheeks that is the worst that I've ever had. This could be due to having recently changed my own personal medication, but I would imagine that if this cleanser worked really well, it would've combated the break outs a bit more effectively. For the price and the quantity, it is a good deal and I will continue to use this product until I have enough proof that it is this particular facial wash that isn't helping my break outs.",14
