Good but..",2.0,The face wash itself is great however the bottle came with the pump completely broken off. It wasnt even in the box to try to be able to fix it. Luckily it was still sealed so nothing leaked but we had to remove the pump from an old face wash and put it in this one to be able to use it.,0

I returned this…",2.0,Lathered well but was way too harsh for my sensitive skin. I broke out in red patches after using this only three times. It also smells like a men’s cologne…which I wasn’t expecting because it says it’s meant for sensitive skin. Maybe it was the fragrance that irritated my face but i wouldn’t recommend for those with reactive skin even tho it says it’s okay for that.,0

Not a gentle face wash.",2.0,This is not a gentle face wash.While getting one pump wash is on the thicker side consistency. Applying a small amount and massaging lightly onto the skin the wash is very strong. Make sure mouth is closed because breathing in through mouth while cleansing face the wash is terribly strong if inhaled. The smell at first is pleasant but then had a terrible odor once rinsing. I thought odor was coming from my shower drain I even cleaned shower thoroughly but then noticed the terrible odor every time once rinsing off was. I’m so lost with this face wash.,0

Dries skin",2.0,"The sodium Laureth sulfate ingredient used in here has been super drying to the skin to the point where I’m peeling like a sunburn. This surfactant should not be used in the cleanser. Super drying. Feels like it’s cleaning but leaves skin tight, dry, and flaky",0

not the best for acne",2.0,"I use this product every day and it hasn't really done anything at all to help my acne, in fact I think my acne may have gotten worse after switching to this cleanser.I guess this is an OK cleanser if you aren't prone to acne, but I don't recommend it if you do have problems with acne.",0

Extremely Scented",2.0,"Having used laroche before for facial cleansing, I was excited to buy this at an Amazon price. Unfortunately I’ve used it once and while washing my face, smelled what can only be described as an entire perfume bottle being sprayed into my nasal cavities. Literally this is so so so heavily scented, so if you’re used to a lighter or unscented cleanser…beware. I’ve returned the item because of the scent amount.",0

Irritation on sensitive skin",2.0,"I have acne prone sensitive skin and tried this gel wash which foams so well and has a light scent to it which I did't mind. However after using it twice or so, I broke out in a rash that was also kind of itchy all over my face almost looks like a heat rash...tried giving it about six days of use both morn and night but it got worse so I've ceased using it. I would not recommend it if you have the same skin type as mine however it may work for others just not for me.Waste of a purchase for me.",0

I want to like it so much...",2.0,"I am very acne prone with oily skin, and I was hoping this would help without harsh acids or peroxides that are in acne-specific treatments.  I have been using this wash for about a month, and while it does have its benefits, I have only broken out in more acne than ever.  I will continue to use in hopes that my skin is simply adjusting. I will update my review to five stars if my skin clears up.Pros: good value. Very little is needed to wash face, and a lot is included in bottle. This will last a long time.I use it in conjunction with the effaclar mat lotion, and both together have really helped the oil build up on my skin. My skin feels fresh and clean after using this.Cons: my skin literally seems to hate this, even though I myself want to like it so much. More acne than ever. Ow. :(",0

So so product.",2.0,Have been using this for a few days and it's making my dry skin areas even dryer and also breaking me out.  Will try for another few days and then scrap it if it doesn't get better.  It leaves my oily areas less oily so that's a plus.  Was hoping for a miracle based on the comments but other than less oily skin..🤷 Will try with a moisturizer and see if that helps.,0

Pump RUSTS!!!??!!!?",2.0,"The liquid product itself is great. However, the metal within the pump apparently rusts and produces a nasty brown sludge as you can see if you look on the pictures I posted (just look under the edge of the screw on cap in the pics). If you reach out to customer service, they will tell you that the pump should not be stored where it can get moist, otherwise it will rust. But this is a liquid product that I imagine most people use in their bathrooms, so I do not see how you could store the pump dry unless you take it apart, cap the bottle with something else, and store the pump head in a dessicated container. This would be akin to selling a bath towel that you tell the customer can't get wet!!  I have other products with pumps with metal components--this is the only one that rusts!",0

Skin became very dry and itchy",2.0,"Unfortunately, this ends up being very drying for my skin.  I tried it for a week, but I found that I was getting dry spots along my forehead and nose.  Once my skin began to feel itchy, I just gave up and bought my normal face cleanser from Sephora.  For $20, I was expecting more.  It looks like I'll be going back to Purity.",0

Dried out my lips but not my face.",2.0,I'm sad. Since I started using this my lips have been EXTREMELY dry but my face is still just as oily. If only I could wash my face without my lips getting wet at all lol But even then its been a couple weeks and I'm seeing no improvement to oily skin.,0

Different formula with fragrance; caused dry spots",2.0,"Not sure what happened as I’m a long term user of this face wash and have purchased both on Amazon and in store at target among others, but this newest shipment had a noticeable new scent to it when there wasn’t a scent before. My skin reacts badly to scented products, but I still tried this new formula and broke out all over my chin and had dry patches on the corners of my mouth from it. If this is a new formula and not just a fake, I do not recommend.",0
