Doesn't smell like the target one does",1.0,"I get this wash because it is gentle and doesn't smell strong. The one I got said ""New Look"" so I looked past the difference of the container. I explained my suspicion to my sister and she said ""smell it! It shouldn't smell!"" The one I got did smell. Like dish soap. I ordered another from Target and no smell. Maybe there are 2 kinds of this soap? Not sure",0

Used and Refilled",1.0,"The bottle is clearly one that has been used for months!  It has that 'film' that can get on items in your shower or grabbed repeatedly with soapy hands, scratches on label and the plastic.  There was not any safety wrapping/seal. The product is watered down and smells off.This type of thing has happened so often the last few months with beauty/care products...!?  It's frustrating.",0

Made my face eczema flare up",1.0,"I thought because this is considered gentle, I was doing myself a favor not using the harsher salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide cleaners, instead I found out I have facial eczema. This product brought it out and I kept thinking it could not be this. Finally I gave it a week using something else and my face is happy again. Throwing this in the trash.",2

Dehydrated my skin",1.0,"Oily, prone to acne skin over here. It cleanses well and didn't break out at all, so 10/10 in that. However, the great turn down for my is:  takes the moisture of my skin away, doesn't matter if you  put even two layers of moisturizer after, my skin was still craving moisture. Even if I had applied  a moisturizer face mask after. I really tried to make it work.  My skin was just so thirsty that I had to give up trying.Do not recommend.",3

Drying, burning and rash",1.0,"Was really hoping this would be great for me, there are such good reviews. I've also use La Roche Posay creme cleanser with no problems. I've been noticing more acne and oil on my skin and thought to try this; I wouldn't classify myself as having overly sensitive skin either.Unfortunately like the other negative reviews this was very drying and the scent was overwhelming. The worst part was a red, patchy eczema like rash around my mouth and smile lines. I used this for 2 days and noticed a slight burning sensation which can be normal for acne/oily skin cleansers but when the rash showed up I stopped. This will be returned and I would recommend a patch test for a couple days before hand, especially if you have sensitive skin. This seems to work well for others but just not me.",0

I wanted it to work but it dried the *** out of my skin!",1.0,"I ordered this cleanser without knowing what the difference between the Effaclar and Toleraine lines are. I used it for 2 days (just once per day) and it really dried out my skin. I have oily, acne-prone skin and I was looking for a cleanser to control my oil production throughout the day but this was just wayyy too stripping. It created dry patches all along my t-zone that took about a week of intense moisturizing to fix. I used this with the Effaclar Mat moisturizer so I'm not sure if it's the combination of the two that dried me out so bad but I'm a little too traumatized to test one or the other. I later learned that the Toleraine foaming cleanser is a much better option because it's more gentle and the formulation is entirely different (it even has niacinimide!) Also this one has fragrance so just something to be aware of. I'll be using the Toleraine line from now on.",2

Excessive Foaming, Heavy Residue",1.0,"This cleanser starts as a thick, unscented gel. A nickel-sized amount, that is the smallest amount that I get pumped out, turns into an excessive amount of foam that continues to foam as you clean your face. It is unpleasant when it gets up your nose and burns the eyes. You could never use this to remove eye makeup. After rinsing it off, a residue remains that feels heavy on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this cleanser.",3

Very disappointed",1.0,"Really wanted to like this.  The branding is great.  You get a ton of product.  But despite the claim that it's tested on acne prone skin and meant for people with oily skin, this was extremely drying to me.  And that's the end of the story when it comes to face washes -- if they are really drying, my skin overcompensates with more oil production, and then I break out worse.  I used it for about four days and then had to stop because my skin was cracking when I opened my mouth.  This was with using a gentle moisturizer along side it.My partner (who has normal skin) used it and had no problem, but he could probably wash with dish soap.  It's certainly going to depend on your skin type and general lot in life.  The only thing that's really worked for me is Proactiv, but even that is inconsistent.",4

Induced massive cystic acne, do not recommend",1.0,"I would give this 0 stars if I could.

It's now mid-October and I'm still trying to get rid of the acne, never mind do something about the scarring!",0

Not for me",1.0,"I have very sensitive skin that reacts differently to basically everything. Based on the online reviews of this product, I thought there wouldn't be any issues but my face was NOT happy after I started using it. Typically, I'll wash my face once a day to prevent overdrying. With this product, my skin became very oily by the end of the day and I had to wash my face again in the evening. This caused drying in some areas that became red rashes. I can only assume some ingredient in this wash didn't mix well with my skin. I stuck it out for about 2 weeks before ordering a different product to help clear up my skin. Fingers crossed the new one works.",0

 I was super excited to try this because so many people said this stuff was amazing and worked well with acne but this stuff made my acne way worse! My face has never been this bad before. Is it supposed to make your acne worse before it gets better?",2

Refused to publish review on their website",1.0,"The reason it isn't a verified purchase is because I bought it directly from LA Roche. The only reason I'm posting here is because they refused to post my review on their website because they disagreed with it.I used this one time and I woke up the next morning with a forehead literally covered in little red irritated and itchy pimples. It has fragrance and a sulfate, aka common skin irritants.I understand different skin responds to products differently. What I don't accept is refusing to publish my review.

TERRIBLE IF YOU HAVE OILY, SENSITIVE SKIN",1.0,"This product recommended to me since I have oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. It doesn't clean the skin thoroughly NOR does it remove excess oil.

HOWEVER, IT COMPLETELY DRIED OUT MY SKIN EVERYWHERE ELSE ESPECIALLY THE CORNERS AROUND MY MOUTH AND LEFT MY SKIN PEELING AND BURNING LIKE CRAZY. Even after applying my moisturizer my skin WOULD STING LIKE HELL. Very very painful. Would not recommend at all.",0

BREAKS YOU OUT & DRIES YOUR SKIN!",1.0,"I bought this product after reading so many great reviews on it helping acne. I have acne prone/combo skin so I figured it would help with my acne & oil. I first tried it and notice that it dried out my skin a bit, especially areas around my mouth and the creases on the side of my nose. Skin started peeling on the side of my nose after the 1st week and when I would put on mosturizer it would sting/burn so bad. I used this product twice a day for nearly a month and it broke me out SO BAD. I wouldn't recommend using it and save yourself from breaking out and dry skin!!",0

caused painful rashes.",1.0,"I purchased this product at a local drug store. I was using it for about a week and then thought I had dry skin forming on the sides of the area under my chin and my cheek. It was supposed to help with oily skin, which it did along my nose, but the pain along the dry areas continued until I realised that it actually formed ichy red rashes on those areas. They are immensly painful. I have been applying hydrating products there but it has increasingly gotten more and more painful as the rash forms. I don't reccommend using this without prior knowledge of how it will affect your skin. Avoid using it in places where you have normal skin. I've switched to a Vichy product instead now that I know this is not the product for me.",0
