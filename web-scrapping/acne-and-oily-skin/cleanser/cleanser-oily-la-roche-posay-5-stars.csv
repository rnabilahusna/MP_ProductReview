Good cleanser for combination skin, though leaves face a bit tight/dry",5.0,"This is a good cleanser. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I wet face, pour some into my hand, foam it up, and rub on my face before rinsing.I have combination skin time (not totally oily and not totally dry). After using this, my face was noticeably less oily and also felt nice and soft. However, if I used this alone, I would have a tight/dry feeling to my face afterwards.My skin routine is to pat the skin dry after using this cleanser and then I apply my other products. I think having a moisturizer is the only essential one to avoid that dry/tight feeling. Personally, before the moisturizer I like to use a Vitamin C serum. In the morning I apply a sunscreen at the end after the moisturizer.",14

Excellent for Oily Sensitive Acne-Prone,  Skin",5.0,"I never heard of this brand or product before until I saw a manufacturer's coupon in the paper for their Effaclar Duo Acne cream product.  Right away, I start to google info about the brand/products.  As always, I also go to Amazon.com to read everyone's reviews about any products.  The reviews were promising and thought I would give the cleanser a try.  I used Obagi Nu Derm product line for almost 3 years.  In the past year, I have had many hormonal monthly breakouts every single month.  I started to trying other products that would clean my oily skin better and prevent big acne cystic breakouts.  I've tried other products like Peter Thomas Roth,  and Cetaphil oily skin cleanser (that didn't break any oils off my skin), and over the counter products, but they left my skin too dry and I still had blemishes and acne, the kind that are big red and bumpy first like a mosquito bite, then it finally breaks through with the pus. ( I know, it's digesting)So far, I have used this foaming cleanser all week.  The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, free of the day's mineral makeup products and removes the oily, shiny skin I have very refreshed and cleansed.  My face felt clean, soft and not tight.  I am in my upper 40s and I don't want products that make my skin feel too dry or tight.  This cleanser leaves my skin feeling soothed, clean and fresh.I am also ordering their Effaclar MToner to complement the cleanser and I will slowly build up the Effaclar line into my skin routine, including the eye cream.  For someone who has had those cystic, hormonal big red bump pimples, I hope this will be my answer to finally get things under control.  My dermatologist gave me Retin A Micro to put on my giant pimples.  All the Retin A did was dry it up a bit, flake my skin along the surrounding area and then as the pimple dries up, it makes it super dark and leaving me with this very dark pigmented scar.  So, I quit using the Retin A too.  I bought the Effaclar Duo acne treatment because it has peroxide which I hope will lighten up the pimple and its scars.I'll have to update this review after a month or two of using the La Roche-Posay products.  But so far, I like the way my skin looks and feel.Update: Feb. 13, 2013:I returned this product as it was overly drying to my oily skin.  It was very effective at drying the oily skin; actually too much for me.  Perhaps for a teenager with extreme oily and acne skin types.",10

Quality you expect for the price",5.0,"I have both the La Roche-Posay and Cetaphil cleansers.  Both are top-rated.  La Roche-Posay is significantly more expensive, but the quality of materials feels at the next level, which makes the price justifiable.  One issue--once you apply it to the face, it's impossible to rinse-off.  Some residue keeps making bubbles.  My solution--rinse it off with a bit of soap.  Problem solved!",2

De todos los que he probado este ha sido el mejor",5.0,"Estoy muy contenta de haber encontrado el gel EFFACLAR de LA ROCHE-POSAY. Mi piel es grasa y tiende a tener acné, espinillas, puntos negros y enrojecimiento ocasional. Después de una semana de usar este gel, todos estos problemas han disminuido significativamente. Mi piel está mucho más limpia y libre de impurezas y grasa. Es fácil y rápido de aplicar, ya sea solo o con un cepillo de limpieza. La textura del limpiador no es muy espesa, hace mucha espuma y se enjuaga fácilmente con agua. Deja la piel con una sensación de frescura y limpieza. Además, tiene un olor agradable y suave. Lo recomiendo altamente ya que es muy efectivo. Seguiré usándolo diariamente junto con otros productos de la marca.",9

Cleared up my lifelong acne",5.0,"Used this and the Neutrogena acne face wash thats orange to clear up my lifelong acne problems. Doesnt dry skin, smells excellent, found out about it from someone on the subreddit for acne problems. Ive tried everything my whole life and managed to get nothing accomplished. Forty something years ive lived with that problem, so to say that im happy is an understatement. I use the neutrogena, rinse it off, use this stuff rinse it off then before i goto bed use differin gel. In the morning nothing but clear dkin.My life has now changed and it only continues to get better. I am forever endebted to the guy at the acne subreddit who told me about it and amazon for being able to get it to me at a reasonable price. I have nothing but love for all of you. If yiu suffer from acne give this stuff a try and most of all never give up. I thought i would be put in my grave with a broken out face. No more. 🌈✌️",21

I only leave reviews when necessary... And this product is NECESSARY.",5.0,"I've struggled with acne for about 20+ years and I have tried every face wash under the sun. A few years ago I bought this face wash, along with the Lipikar moisturizer, on a whim at Target. I liked the no frills design and it was probably on sale or something. I haver never looked back! I have super sensitive skin, it gets really dry, but my nose will get oily. I'm 36 and still get zits once in awhile. So you know, a very special annoying combination of things to be going on with your face. This stuff is just the perfect balance for everything. For acne, it works better than any acne-focused face wash I have ever used. I used to be a loyal Neutrogena customer until I found this brand. It has zero scent. Lathers up well and rinses off easily. No residue. If you don't have dry skin, you might not need a moisturizer with this. However, I do have dry skin so I don't risk it and use the Lipikar after (Also, no scent, absorbs fast, perfect facial lotion). I have done the testing of every face wash at your local Walgreens, CVS, Duane Reade (Or as I like to call it, ""Dwayne Wade""), etc for you, so look no further! Let my face wash journey and many dollars not be in vain! If all of that doesn't convey to you how awesome I think this product is: I wash my face 2-3 times a day and this bottle should last you over a year. OVER A YEAR, SHE SAYS?!? YES, OVER. A. YEAR.",2

First cleanser I actually love!!",5.0,"I have combination to oily skin. Before using La Roche Posay, I had bumps all over my forehead because of my bangs (which I've had for over 6 years) and I got so disgusted looking at my forehead I needed to do something about it and invest in a good cleanser that was inexpensive. I used to use St. Ives, Clean and Clear, and Neutrogena then my friend let me try some of her La Roche Posay products and I absolutely loved it and bought this cleanser ASAP.After using this cleanser for about two weeks I noticed a difference in my skin and it was clearing up (especially my forehead). I was happy with my purchase. It's super gentle on my sensitive skin and the product lasts a long time. After three months of using this product I found out what works for me.Some tips and tricks with using this product- Know your skin type!!!- Remove any makeup before washing your face- rinse your face with warm water and wash the cleanser off with warm water. After washing, splash your face with COLD water- Make sure to activate the product in your hands before applying it on the face, don't apply it directly after taking the product out- wash your face for a sold minute and a half to ensure a good cleansing-  ALWAYS MOISTURIZE RIGHT AFTER CLEANSING OR CONTINUE WITH YOUR SKIN CARE ROUTINE- If you're more combo than oily, only use this cleanser once a day or else it will dry our your skin. If you want to cleanse twice a day, invest in a lighter formula of this cleanser.If you don't moisturize right after or continue with your skin care routine, you won't notice a visible difference. Always hydrate the skin after cleansing. If you're looking for immediate results, this might not be your product. For me with most products, I notice a difference after consistent uses up to two weeks. Patience is key with trying new skin care products because your skin needs to get used to what you're putting on it. Knowing your skin type helps a lot too with finding cleansers and products that will suit your skin needs.Overall, this cleanser from La Roche Posay works for me and I absolutely love the results from it. If you're not into scents or smells, this product has a very light scent. Not fruity, or strong just smells refreshing.",2

Skincare Junkie with Problem Skin...NO B.S. Honest Review",5.0,"I am a light complected African-American woman, age 44, who has been dealing with adult acne for a number of years, and have tried almost every expensive cleanser and skin-care product being peddled in department and beauty stores.This was one of the cleansers on my dermatologist's recommendation list, and for once, only after it popped up in some other search I did on Amazon, I decided to try this oil-free gel cleanser from a brand I had NEVER HEARD OF.Flash forward to its arrival and my first time using it. My skin INSTANTLY felt TRULY CLEAN, and smooth, and when I raised my head from rinsing my face in the sink, and was able to see myself clearly in the mirror after patting my face dry, I was AMAZED. No BS! My skin was visibly glowing, and for once, not with oil buildup. Touching my face, it was smooth and soft, and my face did not feel the least bit dry or tight.I was convinced enough to keep using this product, which is so much more reasonably priced than other ""miracle"" cleansers. It's been more than a month now, and I actually LOVE washing my face, my pores are smaller, and my breakouts have stopped. I am coming back for another bottle so that I can keep one in my shower, and one on my vanity for convenience.I rely heavily on reviews, and I figured it was time that I started writing them, because I buy and try a TON of things in many categories, and I want to help other people decide what could be actually worth their hard-earned money.I can't swear this will work for everyone, as we all have different body chemistry. But NO B.S.--it has been a life-changing product for me, so I only hope if someone else takes a chance on it like I did, they experience the same positively amazing results. Good luck!",230

Just starting using and already seeing a difference!!!",5.0,"Ok, so I initially ordered for my tween son who recently started to breakout with little pimples along his hairline and T-zone, but have even started using myself!!  We have tried several (expensive) face washes from Aveda, Sephora, health stores and even the local drug store.Nothing REALLY helped much, so I read some online articles with dermatologist recommendations and this product popped up several times. After reading reviews and product info, I decided to give it a try.  We have only been using ( twice a day) for last 4 days, but I have already noticed an improvement in my son’s skin!! So much that I started using myself for my 30-something combination skin.  The bottle is huge, compared to other products we have tried (that we’re 1/3 the size and twice the $) and my son says he likes the smell and feel of this face wash. It’s light and easy to lather. It’s gentle and has a subtle clean smell. It hasn’t dried out my son’s sensitive pre-teen skin ( or my adult skin) and I’m hoping it will continue to help clear his complexion. Going through puberty is not a fun time and I don’t want my son to develop insecurities regarding his skin. 😕  I’m sure this product won’t work for EVERYONE out there, but I’m glad we tried this!! Fingers crossed that this face wash continues to help give my son his nice, clear complexion back and his self confidence!!!! 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽",40

Recommended by my dermatologist.",5.0,"This is the best face wash I’ve ever used. I’ve tried many over the years including quite a few recommended by dermatologist. This was recommended by my current dermatologist after going to get a few skin cancers removed. I have very sensitive-combination skin, deep pores and a lot of sun damage. It is purifying as stated so it will cause all impurities to come to the surface. Don’t be alarmed, that’s a good thing. Keep using it. It will also dry your skin some as it’s treating sun damage, not fun but necessary, so definitely get the moisturizer that best suits your skin type.",8

 It is definitely meant for sensitive skin, and the way it makes my face feel before AND after! I highly recommend, also as you can see in the picture, before mixing in my serum. It brightens your skin after the first 3 washes. I also have a skin routine that I do to keep my skin clean. It definitely makes your face feel like a babies bottom after use. But I don’t like that it makes my face EXTREMELY dry once dry. I’d give it an 8/10",13

Yes for hormonal acne!",5.0,"So I struggle from hormonal acne. BAD. To the point where it hurt and made me feel beyond insecure. Especially since I’m nearly 30 with these massive bumps in my face. I have tried so many different types of face wash it’s insane.But this right here, the bottle is massive, it’s so gentle and barely any smell.I use this twice a day.

Godsend for Oily Skin",5.0,"I can only assume that everyone else trying this product has also tried a dozen other skincare products that claim to eliminate oily skin while also being sensitive enough not to dry it out. I also assume that most people looking at this product failed to find a legitimate skincare product that works. Perhaps it is because the French are fancy and expect the best, but they do know how to make one hell of a face wash.When I first tried the product, I thought it was useless because it felt quite close to water on my face (although it is still viscous--it's a weird feeling you will get used to). The smell is also a little off: kind of like grandma's house but with a medical cleaner edge. Despite the smell and the lack of that ""I am definitely clean!"" feeling, this stuff has done miracles for my face. It does not dry my face out, which means my face is not constantly trying to defeat itself by producing more oil and it does a nice job of keeping ""the shine"" away (all of you with oily faces know what I am talking about). It is my go-to morning shower face wash and it has really helped my skin look better.As usual, this product may not be the one for you (curse you dermatological Gods!) but it is the one that works for me. Buy one, use it for a week, and see what happens. Good luck!",78

My dermatologist has me using this and I LOVE IT",5.0,"My dermatologist started me on this face wash a few years back and I have loved it ever since. They sell this brand in office but it is the smaller bottle, when I saw Amazon has this in larger bottles I JUMPED on it. I love the pump bottle in the larger side. I will say however, my pump in the last order came broken but it is bearable so I did keep it. Was probably just due to shipping.This face wash is great for morning and evening routine and great for sensitive skin! I use the Toleriane moisturizer also sold by LaRoche Posay in combination with this face wash. I am also on Tretinoin lotion (doctor prescribed) which can be pretty intense and harsh on the skin; this face wash is great for use with that medication it does not further irritate my skin.",0
