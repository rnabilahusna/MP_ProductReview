Pretty good",4.0,"It took a while for my skin to adapt. For the forst few uses my skin would puff up and redden and itch alot but after using it alpt more, the only thing it does is dry up the spots I apply it to. I apply it at night and when I wake up the pimple is gone. I usually make sure to moisturize alot more when using this product.",7

Harsh but EFFECTIVE!",4.0,This product is realllyyy good for whiteheads. I’ll put this on a white head and either the next day or day after it will be risen! But I wouldn’t just put it everywhere bc it has made my skin mad sensitive and kind of burn if I put too much on!,2

great product, but…",4.0,"i love this product a lot and i like to use it whenever i feel like i have a pimple coming in but you must use it lightly because it can burn your skin. maybe i have sensitive skin or maybe it’s because i’m fair skinned, but it’s happened to me several times that i’ve applied the cream and the next day i notice that where i placed the cream i have like a very very light purple shade. idk i rlly like this product because i feel like it does help a bit that’s why i’m trying to give it the benefit of the doubt.",15

Worth The Wait!",4.0,"this stuff has been all over my fyp on tiktok and i had to see what the hype was about. being completely honest, i think it’s quite effective, as long as you’re consistent. but that means it takes some time, like up to a week, for full results. not bad, though!",5

Great may take time, may be fast",4.0,Tip because I see a lot of people not liking itDon’t use daily (at first at least)Pair with right products (some cause more irritation imo look up what to not pair BP with)Stick it in you routine where it best fits you  (maybe after cleansing and something hydrating and then all your other products or after all your products)Can be so damaging so use it correctly,2

Enjoying it so far",4.0,"I’ve heard tons about this product from tiktok and so far it is performing how I expect. I’ve heard it causes purging at first and I am definitely experiencing some of that. Albeit I’m not sure if my skin just disagrees with it because benzoyl peroxide can be rough on sensitive skin. I will say it has helped me clear pimples I have gotten, faster than I think they would clear on their own, but hasn’t done much for the little bumps that have come up since starting this product. This might just be me, but the product came in a box with a thin plastic sleeve sealed around it, but my plastic had been torn a bit. Because the product doesn’t have a safety seal inside I was weary of using it but I figured the tear was just from it getting caught in tape or something.",5

Works!! Just be careful...",4.0,"So far this is helping with my hormonal acne.I am in my early 30s, I was formerly on Accutane (about 10 years ago) and have been on the pill ever since which kept my acne under control. When I went off the pill this year I experienced horrible acne as a result. I have extremely sensitive skin and had bad reactions to benzoyl peroxide in the past (with welts and swollen eyelids just like the photos people have shown). But I was desperate to find an effective product. The secret, I've found, is to only use this during the day. Otherwise, it winds up rubbing off on your pillowcase and into your eyes. This product is NOT good for eyelids lol.What I do is mix a tiny bit in with my morning moisturizer. I wash it off at night and then combine my moisturizer with Retin-A to wear while I sleep. I get some slight irritation still, a little bit of itchyness, but my breakouts have decreased significantly (even during my period). I also noticed a HUGE change in the texture of my skin. Before this my forehead felt bumpy and rough no matter how much I exfoliated. After a week using this product it is crazyyy soft and smooth. Which I attribute to the LHA. Be patient (and careful) and I'm fairly confident you'll see results.UPDATE: I now swear by this product! I was patient with it and it truly paid off. My uncontrollable hormonal acne has been clear for months!! My skin is smooth and soft and I don't even have to worry about makeup or other products causing breakouts anymore as long as I use a touch of this with my moisturizer every morning. The irritation and itching has also completely stopped. HIGHLY recommend, just be sure to read my warnings above.",141

Not obsessed but still helpful",4.0,Does the trick on a pimple with a white heard but for cystic acne I do not find it to be the most helpful of products. Didn’t see the total tiktok hype but I also have more deeper cystic based acne. Don’t over use or it will dry your skin out.,4

Works after a while",4.0,It works but like many skin products you have to use it for a while before you see any results. It made my skin very dry when I first started using it and i had to alternate between using this product and moisturizer. I did see great results after a a few weeks of use!,2

Perfect sized nozzle",4.0,"Just like you, I was skeptical when I first saw this product. The idea of squirting benzoyl peroxide in such a sensitive area was offputting, but I knew I had to do something about my urethral cystic acne.  The nozzle on this tube is perfectly designed to be inserted into the tip of the urethra and I could feel the product tingling/burning all the way down to the base of my member (that means its working).Now we just wait to see if the cystic acne subsides.",5

Good spot treatment",4.0,"Oh boy, it works, maybe a little too well. I have dry skin but get cystic acne and little things here and there. I use this as a spot treatment and it takes care of it by the next day. However, you need to put it directly on the spot and no where else if you have sensitive skin like mine because it literally burned my skin, made this awful texture that I had for about a week. So be careful with it, less is more.",3

It does what it has to do",4.0,"This works great at drying out pimples. Just be aware that it is very drying and bc it’s a higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide, it may burn or even itch for a while. Start like two days a week, do it at night and pair it with a thick moisturizer that you like. It is a great spot treatment",0

Gentle and seems to work",4.0,"I've had this product for approximately 6 weeks.  When I purchased it, I was suffering from large, inflamed, cystic-type acne on the bridge of my nose, right between my eyes.  This product was gentle enough for me to feel comfortable applying it so closely to my eyes.  It doesn't burn or sting, has no noticeable scent and doesn't dry out my skin like similar drugstore treatments marketed toward teenagers.  The product also feels more luxurious and creamy than other products and sinks into skin without leaving a residue.  It seemed to help the cysts heal a bit faster then the normal length of 3 weeks or so.  I try to use it every day on trouble spots (sometimes I forget) and, at least for now, it has helped me from getting cysts in the same areas over and over.  I would recommend this product even though it does cost a bit more than other drugstore treatments.  It does bleach fabrics, so take care with sheets, towels and washcloths when using this.",4

Good product",4.0,"This is a great product, I use this as a spot treatment.  I do find that it minimizes the size of a pimple. It does take around three days for pimple to dry up. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful not to put this product throughout the day because it is drying. Use a pea size amount when using as a spot treatment if you use a lot of product and if you put it on 3x a day in one spot, the area sometimes gets red. All in all I do like the results that this product gives my acne prone face that's why I purchased the full size. I can see that it heps decrease the amount of breakouts as it also helps pimples go away. I bought two La Roche Posay products and so far I've been enjoying them. I would say to get a sample at your local Walgreen store or at ulta ( take your on small container) before you decide to purchase since it is pricey.",12

Read the directions",4.0,I read the directions and it mentions that it is very drying. They are not kidding! It definitely dried out the pimple but it also severely dried the skin around it too. In the future I plan to only dab a tiny amount directly on the pimple.,0

I have been having horrible breakouts recently",4.0,"I have been having horrible breakouts recently. And this topical cream by La Roche-Posay has been the only thing that made my skin clear up. It dries out all types of acne pretty fast--even the angry, bulging, aching cystic ones. And it does a far better job than any other acne treatments I have tried.That being said, there are some minor downsides that are worth mentioning. First, it is really drying and excessive application can make your skin flake off. So start with using this just once a day, and only apply the smallest amount necessary. Second, while the product description says this cream is good for blemishes too, it is only true in the sense that it prevents blemishes from further infection. From my experience it has had zero effect on reducing scarring or hyper-pigmentation that results from a breakout.",7

Works Great for Adult Acne",4.0,"I use this 1-2 times daily for my adult acne.  It worked great at first, but now it seems to be on and off.  I suggest using it once a day to start until your skin gets used to it.  I use it in the am usually and make sure to put on SPF over it if I am going outside at all.  It helps to prevent acne and it helps to dry up pimples quickly - especially if you use it as soon as you feel a pimple coming on.I purchase it here on Amazon a lot because it gets to me quick and I'm too lazy to drive to Ulta to pick it up!",17

Get this before you buy other acne products!!!",4.0,"Excellent product for acne. My lady bought a small starter set from Ulta for me to try and see if it'll make a change. I'm glad to say its been one heck of a journey because I been struggling with acne as a teen, using product from various of sources and after several usage of the starter set, my acne went down drastically.So I made the effort of buying this from Amazon for us to use and all of its La Roche-Posay product because I love how advance it is vs those acne product other customers find at Walmart, Target, or big retail stores that seems to do the job but not a much of a change like the La Roche-Posay.",3

I am in my late 20s and suffer from cystic acne and have tried a lot of different products. I'm still skeptical so that is why only four stars at this time but my skin does look much clearer! It's drying but not the same as other products i have used. I am using a lotion morning and night with it to help keep my skin moisturized but the one I am using is not from this brand.

Great Spot Treatment",4.0,"This seems to work pretty well for me, but it is drying and since I've been doing the oil cleansing method (jojoba oil and castor oil)- I only use this product as a spot treatment 1-2 times a week whenever I have a break out.  I've been trying to do the natural products to keep my acne away ( I was getting 5-10 spot a week). Since using the oil cleansing method, I only get 1 acne spot a week or every 2 weeks now and for that I use this as a spot treatment. I have tried a lot of other over the counter products with Benzoyl Peroxide and it just doesn't work for me except for this one.

Decent spot treatment",4.0,"I've been using this as spot treatment for quite a while (more than a year; on and off, whenever I have acne) now, and I really like it. Honestly speaking, it's not the best as in the method that brings the fastest result, but it's a decent product for long term use. I have combination, acne-prone skin so I pay close attention to any skin care product I've used. This cream doesn't overly dry my skin out when I use it many days in a row and it does a brilliant job in calming my skin on the stubborn days.Overall I do recommend this for those who doesn't mind waiting for a long-lasting outcome.

Incredible but extremely drying",4.0,"Within the first 2 days of using this product morning and night my acne had cleared up. I have normal-dry skin and do not usually have acne issues but I started to break out badly around my lower cheeks and chin area. I was very pleased with this product but after about 5 days of using it my skin became EXTREMELY dry and flaky. I continued using it (because this product is intended to prevent further breakouts) but before I would apply it, I would use a moisturizer. This did not help because the product would not be able to dry out the blemishes effectively. So basically, wonderful product for those with oily skin I'm sure, but for me it was nearly impossible to deal with/fix the flakiness while continuing to use the product.",0

Good stuff!",4.0,I am giving it a 4 star because it does dry out your skin. I have a very oily skin and not sensitive. It does work. In just one week I got rid of all my pimples on the forehead that I was fighting with forever. So it works but it will dry out your skin if you use it too much. I now just do spot treatment.The best thing.. absolutely no smell.,2

Works well, causes some irritation",4.0,"This product is very effective at clearing up my acne, but did cause some dryness and peeling. I found that titrating up the frequency helped somewhat, but some parts of my face require less than others. The product has a great consistency and does not smell, as many other products I've tried do. Only a small amount is needed, if you use too much it will irritate your face. I would recommend this to anyone who has acne that is not cured by other drugstore products, it is not as effective as a prescription, but is more effective than anything else I've tried.",2

She uses the Effaclar only once a day. It has helped clear up her acne and hasn't dried out her skin, I would recommend this product because it doesn't dry the skin out and it does clear up the acne.

Works well",4.0,"Before I steam on ahead with my review I'll fill you in on skin's background so you'll have an idea what I'm dealing with. If you can't be arsed reading the entire thing, read the bottom line.Throughout my teens, I had good skin. I did have the occasional breakout around my time of the month but other than that, I managed to escape acne in my school years. Same deal as I got older, my skin is combination of oily and dry in some places. In the past 2 years, (I'm 24) I started getting these absolutely gorgeous breakouts just under my chin and my neck, and they were entirely hormonal, by the way ladies, if you get the odd breakout around your period, whatever side breaks out is the ovary that ovulates apparently. Anyway, these breakouts where large, under the skin numbers and they were pretty painful. I'm sorry to say that I am a picker. Disgusting but I find it satisfying. Obviously, I am insane. After about six months of 'Dude, what is that on your NECK?!' I went to the doctor, who prescribed Zineryt which quickly got rid off the problem.Some 18 months later I moved to NY (from Ireland), and October 2013 I started a different pill, cerazette, and after about 9 weeks of various other side affects (nothing major) I started to break out around my chin and lower jaw in general. Proper cystic acne. Painful, and didn't always come to a head. It took me a while to realize it was my pill that was causing this, it looked terrible. Red, painful and just plain abysmal, for someone who never really had acne. I came off cerazette and after about two weeks, there was a small improvement, but honestly, nothing major. I came off it in around February off this year. I tried Zineryt again which, to my dismay, only improved it a small amount. I also tried Burt's Bee's Acne Targeted Spot Treatment, which in all fairness, I imagine would work pretty well for someone who had a few breakouts, as it did clear up my skin a bit. About 3 weeks ago I was speaking to a friend and she put me onto Effaclar Duo. She said she recommended it to everyone and it worked wonders for her, and in fairness, her skin was worse than mine.  She said I could order it online, however the benefit of living in NYC and not a small town in Ireland is that I can now easily access such things. I bought this in Duane Reade by the way, not Amazon, but I read all my reviews on Amazon before purchasing. I think it was $31 altogether, and then after I week I purchased the foaming cleanser. Anyway, I applied this when I got home and when I woke up the next day, I swear there was an improvement. I was practically SKIPPING about my apartment. Over the next few days I continued using it morning and night, after I gently cleansed my face. On day 3 I noticed my skin started getting tighter, and by the end of the day in work I noticed that it had become, dry, flaky and patchy under my make up. I knew this would happen so I wasn't surprised, but still, lizard skin = horrible. I applied Avene Cicalfate Restorative Cream to my dry skin but also kept using Effaclar Duo, I just skipped wearing make up for a few days and the dry skin passed as quickly as it arrived.Its now just over 2 weeks later and my skin is about 80% better. The Effaclar Duo has reduced the redness and scaring as well as controlled the breakouts, plus its brought all those horrible lurker type spots to a head. Some people act surprised when something like this makes them break out, they don't seem to get that its bringing everything to a head. It has to get a little bit worse before it can get better.Seeing as I've rambled on long enough I may as well mention the difference in the European version and the American, which has 5% BP, unlike the French version. I mentioned to my friend (who, living in Ireland, obviously used the French version) said that she too experienced the dry, flaky skin for a few days. However, I've found that if I use this too often it slightly burns my face, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Lizard skin I can deal with, a red burning face for a few minutes is a bit much for 5 stars. Also, its cheaper at home, around 14/15 GBP, which even with conversion, works out cheaper. Benzoyl Peroxide isn't exactly known to do wonders for the skin, so after my skin clears up I'm going to get my sister to airmail some off the French version, or just stock up when I return home.The foaming cleanser is nice, but I found using both right after each other doesn't help much with the burning skin sensation. Possibly my skin is a tad more sensitive than I thought it was. Furthermore, I've increased my water intake in an attempt to improve my skin, but bottom line, I'm pretty sure its the Effaclar Duo that's doing the hard work. Pretty soon I hope to stop using my heavy duty MAC concealer. Speaking of which, I've also made sure I apply said concealer with clean brushes and sponges.Apologies for long review, long & short off it, I recommend you give it a whirl!",2

It actually does work pretty well it's a higher concentration than I've used before",4.0,Up until recently I was on retinol for quite a while but my skin is cleared and I decided to stop the regimen. I have noticed a few blemishes here and there popping up again. You have to be very careful when on retinol and there are a lot of things you have to do and I didn't want to start that again so I decided to try this cream. I have been using it just as a spot reducer because I have very sensitive skin. They benzoyl peroxide is in a higher dose that I have ever used before so I went slow and small at first. this did not irritate my skin like I thought it would and that is a great surprise. I have noticed a little bit of flaking and the drying of skin but I think that's part of the blemish healing process. It definitely reduced the time that it's been taking for one of my pimples to heal. For me it's between three and five days and that's pretty good considering some of mine hang out for quite a while sometimes. Overall I'm pretty pleased with this product.,0

Effective But Caused Redness/Flaking of Skin",4.0,"I'm an adult with occasional acne, and have mixed feelings about this product. On one hand, I do think it shortened the ""life cycle"" of the pimples I've applied it too -- it took 3 ish days to go away as opposed to the usual 7 ish days if I applied right at the start of the pimple. The downside is that my skin hasn't loved it. The area around the pimple where the cream touched stings for a bit after applying the cream, and my skin turned red/flaky around the pimple as well. Since I only use this once every few months for a spot treatment, I don't mind the reaction much for the trade-off on a shorter pimple life, but I wouldn't want to use this product regularly or over a large portion of my face. My skin runs slightly sensitive but not overly so, so for those with definitely sensitive skin I'd say find another brand/product.",2

Works great, but can dry out skin",4.0,"I've been using La Roche-Posay sunscreen for years, and when I saw they made products for acne-prone skin I decided to give it a try. I also noticed the Effaclar Duo contains Benzoyl Peroxide, which has always been effective at treating my breakout-prone skin. (For background, I am in my early thirties with oily skin and pores that tend to get clogged very easily, causing a lot of breakouts. Most acne treatments tend to be pretty rough on my skin, so I've been on a search for something that really works but doesn't irritate my skin.)I've been using the Effaclar Duo for about a month now and it's done a great job of clearing up my skin. Within the first few days I saw a major difference.I wash my face with the 
La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel, 6.76-Ounce Tube
, wait about 5 minutes to allow my skin to dry, and then apply a small amount of the Effaclar Duo all over my face. The tube is small, but you really don't need a large amount of the product. After I've given it a few minutes to absorb into my skin I apply moisturizer. I recently started using 
La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid  1.35-Ounces
, and it's really wonderful as well.My skin has gotten a little dry, and I've had some flaking with the skin around my mouth, but from past experience I know this isn't unusual when using Benzoly Peroxide. Now that I've been using Effaclar Duo for a few weeks the flakiness has definitely decreased and my skin has adapted to the product. And I noticed that when I began using the Toleraine Fluid moisturizer my skin stopped flaking.Overall my skin looks great. It's clear and bright, without any new acne popping up. And obviously I would recommend purchasing the product from Amazon...I found it's about $10 cheaper here than in stores.",5

Great for some breakouts",4.0,"I have sensitive, redness-prone combo skin and have been experiencing several breakouts over the past few years (I got through high school and college just fine but it seems adult acne has claimed another victim...) My breakouts are pretty minor comparatively but this has helped tremendously with everything except for the cystic spots. For blackheads and whiteheads, this generally clear them up in a day or two. I do experience some lingering redness if I use it as directed (several times a day) so if you have sensitive or dry skin I would recommend you don't go to heavy-handed with the application. With the cystic spots I haven't noticed any real improvement. It's a very harsh drying product so i just get more redness and flaking in the area. It's a bit pricey but regardless, it's well worth it. If you can catch a pimple early enough this can stop it dead in its tracks. I like to layer it along with a few other products such as Mario Badescu's buffering lotion, hydrocortisone cream (which helps cut down on redness and swelling) The whole Effaclar line has proved very effective and gentle overall (with the exception of this product as it is definitely not gentle)",0

A Higher Level Of Benzoyl Peroxide",4.0,"Many skincare products contain Benzoyl Peroxide, a treatment for acne, but I think this product, LA Roche- Posey Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment Cream with Benzoyl Peroxide has a higher level of Benzoyl Peroxide at 5.5%, which is this products only active ingredient, so you do see a difference in how your skin looks about a day faster than other products that contain Benzoyl Peroxide.I had a few red splotches on my face, and by Day Two they were less visible, but not totally gone.  So their claim of clearer skin in Three Days sounds about right.  It did leave a slight burning feeling on my skin.They suggest that you start using it once per day, then you can increase it to two or three times a day.",0

Works, maybe?",4.0,"I don’t have acne, so I gave this to my 17 year old daughter to try out. So, far, she says she likes the product, and thinks “maybe” it works, but it’s definitely not the miracle cure they are advertising. Maybe results in three days, but certainly not dramatic. She has not noticed any irritation of her skin, and the product is mild smelling and seems to go on easily and clearly. Definitely better than the Clearisil and Oxy Ten of my youth, but worth the price tag? The jury is still out.",0

and it burns like hot tamales on your face",4.0,"Alright, I'm giving this baby 4 starts because it's effective, and in two days, I saw my acne clear up while using the effeclar system. The only cons for this baby is that it is expensive, and it burns like hot tamales on your face. Try using it once a day and then work up to two a day.",0

I could see changes on may face like 1-2 days later",4.0,"This product is incredible! I could see changes on may face like 1-2 days later, I really wanted to keep using this product, but something within the ingredients made my face really itchy so I had to stop using it, I was so sad that I had to stop using the product. Anyway if it didn't make my face itch then I would have kept using it.",0

pretty sensitive with adult onset acne",4.0,"I have very picky skin, pretty sensitive with adult onset acne. Typically I cannot tolerate Benzoyl Peroxide, but this is much more gentle than Proactiv and Kate Spade, in my opinion. I do not use this daily, but every other day, sometimes every third day and has done such wonders. Immediately my acne became less pronounced, the redness of my spots no longer looked as ""angry."" At this point I am considering this a must have and will update if anything changes!",0
