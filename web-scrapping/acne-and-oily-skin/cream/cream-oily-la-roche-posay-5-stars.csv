great!",5.0,"I've recommended this product to three people already and all of them love it!!! If you have clogged pores on your forehead, nose, cheeks, or chin this will get rid of that in 1-2 days! Completely smooth and clean skin! However, it's important to remember that you have to apply *very minimal* amounts in every area. Meaning, to use the thinnest layer, it's a really strong product and could irritate your face if you over-apply. Also, I strongly recommend not to use any other products for your face while using, I did and I got chemical burns so please be aware of what you pair with the product if you choose to pair anything at all.My routine while using this product is to wash my face, and then apply a very thin layer on the problem areas. I do this twice a day for three days and then return to my normal routine. I love it!!!",9

100 Stars! Amazing Benzoyl Peroxide. Gentle and Effective.",5.0,"This benzoyl peroxide is amazing. I use it daily to prevent and control hormonal breakouts.I've been battling hormonal breakouts since puberty about 3 decades ago. There weren't a lot of options then. I thought Proactiv and Clean & Clear Persagel 10 were my holy grail when I first discovered benzoyl peroxide and used them religiously throughout my 20s and early 30s to achieve clear skin. But thanks to aging, my skin started to change. It was less oily, more sensitive, and drier. I began to use a lower percentage which was working fine until about 2 years ago. It seems that I am going through ""second"" puberty and hormones are raging again. The lower percentage wasn't enough to control the acne and now my old skin cannot handle a higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide. Until I found this and gave it a try.It goes on so smoothly, with no white powder or grit. It doesn't bleach my clothes or sheets. It doesn't dry or irritate my skin even though it is 5.5%. Feels gentle like 2.5%. And the other ingredients actually make it feel like a soothing and moisturizing jelly when I first put it on and they make my skin so smooth. It controls my acne perfectly. This stuff works like 10% but feels like 2.5%.It's amazing! Definitely worth the price. And it's FSA eligible.",31

Wotks great and worth the price. Litle goes long wau",5.0,"Worrh every penny.  I started to have trouble with adult acne (maybe some mask-ne?)Anyway over the period of a week i broke out in about 15 zitz.I was bad, popping them myself (which come to find out only spreads the bacteria under the skin creatong More Zits...not ---to mention potential scarring.Anyway this stuff was given a Best award in about 5 magazines and some other skin care sites.I got about 6 more pimples waiting for 1 day shipping.I dabbed a 2 lentil size ammount and spread it over the problem area. Overnight grounders disappeared by 75% amd all of the white pus ones dried up.After one more night (and some gentle exfoiliating with a microfiber face cloth) all of the scabs from where i picked it are gone and just the slightest bumpy rexture remains.This stuff is So worth it.  I have tried others in t ggf e past without as much expense.I hightly recommend.I found a decent wash system (organiclear acne system) that will hopefully head off guture outbreakes. $30 for a 30 day supply.I wish that the roche-possay, murad and dermalogica systems were not so pricy as they have ither face care benefits for say agong skin (in mid 40's and I really Shoild lock down a good skin care routone.Im also using Neutrogena rapid dark circle correcter and was using 3 step PUR skin care for aging skin. It has salaxylic acid...so im not sure why it didnt stop the breakouts.I am also using a previously purchase serum by Eva containining Hydrolauric Acis, Retinol. And several other hood things. .Update: this is my new routine. Still love the product but found this combo is great.This is amazing!  I started getting adult chin acne & i had splotchy skin & redness and some brown spots.2x a dayI started using Murad Clarifying cleanser& The LaRoche Pose Touralaine Double acting moisturier in the afterMurad Salacylic Acid Outsmart acne in the AM followedAnd Baebody eye creme.I use murad outsmart acne in under moisturizer in the amAnd LaRoche-Pose effaclear in the evening.My skin looks great (i am still getting acne but much smaller).I truely think the Clarifying Cleanser and this Moisturizer are making my skin glow.The product is a bit pricey but everything will last at least 6 mos, maybe a year...so over all it is nit an expensive regimine.I also use tge baebody on non eye wrinkles tgat are starting.  It looks like it comes in a jar but it has a pump thingie so you dont contaminate tge cream.All together it was maybe just under $100 but it will last so long and works so well it is affordable.This is the best moisturizer i have used.",22

I’ve tried everything and this is working so far",5.0,"I’ve struggled with acne all my life. When I was younger it was cystic and now in my 30s it’s hormonal closed comedonal  acne that eventually flairs into a medium size pimple that leaves hyperpigmentation for at least 5 weeks. What I noticed recently about my acne was that pimples would form in small clusters ( not sore or tender) at a high rate under my skin (whitehead) then come to surface, this was because of the amount of bacteria buildup. I found this treatment on tik tok and decided to try. IT WORKS with killing the bacteria and flattening ON SITE. I’ve tried everything else from spiro to tret to azaleic acid and nothing has worked. It makes sense now bc my issue was bacteria buildup. The bp kills within 2-3 treatments . I use it all over my face even though it’s only a spot treatment. Fair warning it is harsh on the skin and will also dry out and even pigment the skin where the acne was. For me The pigmented skin flakes off within two days so it’s not bad. I wish I would have done my research earlier on this product. I will provide another update a month from. Good luck to all!",28

best thing for hormonal acne",5.0,"I would like to start off my describing my skin type. i am a 20 year old female, I have very oily skin and hormonal acne mainly around my chin. I have prescription acne medicine and nothing works for me. I saw this product on tik tok, and with further research, immediately bought it. I will say i hated it at first. it burned and made my skin SUPER dry. but now i’m obsessed with it. i use the cerave foaming cleanser, cetaphil moisturizing face lotion, and this acne treatment. works amazing. i will say it makes your skin super dry, so i put a little bit of aquaphor on my skin before applying this product. a little bit goes a long way, trust me. you only need maybe a grain of rice sized amount and apply it to where your breakout are. I use 2-3 times a day now and my skin is glowing. i’ve only been using this product for 5 days and my acne is clearing up and my skin looks amazing! this works so much better than my prescription medicine! love love love this stuff. will be repurchasing again! this product is a must for stubborn acne. i am currently on my period and haven’t had a new breakout since i started using this product. it’s worth the money!",13

Amazing product",5.0,This product is amazing. I have never had acne in my life. A month and a half before my wedding I decided to get a facial and suddenly had cystic acne on one side of my face. They just kept getting bigger and bigger over a month and my normal salicylic acid face wash was doing nothing. I ordered this product and in 2 days had significant reduction in the appearance of the acne and now at day 5 they are completely flat! This product saved my skin for my wedding day. I wish I had found it sooner,9

Great product !!!!",5.0,So yes it gave me an allergic reaction at first my face for super red. Looked like it was burned. I have very sensitive skin. However once it goes away in one one or two days your skin looks incredible. It does burn and itch but it does wonders. Never should be put around the eye area or the lips. It’s scary but worth it. I use it once a week because my skin is so sensitive.,4

It works! Pimples STOPPED in under a week",5.0,"Thank you! Thank you! Please don't ever change this product! One week and I am already seeing a HUGE improvement. No daily pimples! I followed another reviewer's advice and mixed a little of this (half a dime size) with my moisturizer (about a quarter size) and applied each morning. No irritation and NO PIMPLES.I'm in my early 40s and two years into horrible hormonal acne. I never had acne as a teen, didn't know what to do and have been desperately trying products. Nothing has helped before. I even stopped wearing makeup 18 months ago (working remote during covid, so why bother). Didn't stop the acne.I wake up to an average of two dozen new white heads every morning the week before my cycle and have about five new deep cystic spots a month and the other three weeks I get a few new pimples each morning and watch the horrible red blemishes slowly try to heal from the week of hellish acne only for it all to repeat again.I have not had any new pimples in a week of using Effaclar. NOT ONE PIMPLE. My face is not in pain or inflamed and the blemishes are fading fast, too. I have one spot in particular that has been angry red for two months, but three days of spot treating and it is now GONE! Like it was never there! I am so relieved. Thank you!",7

Eczema, horrible acne and sensitive skin! It works!",5.0,"I've always had horrible cystic acne due to my eczema and just SUPER sensitive skin. I had tried benzoyl when I was in HS and it worked but the prescribed % was low and didn't work after about 6 years. I stopped using that and recently in my 30s my acne has creeped up again. Redness, painful spots, blackheads and clogged pores. No matter what I used it just wouldn't stop. I researched the best product with benzoyl to see whay I could try without prescription. And came across this. I read a huge amount of reviews. I decided to order and yes its pricey but it works! I'm on 2 weeks of using the product and it's great. USE AS DIRECTED. And you'll be fine. Try small spots to see how your skin reacts. If it starts to dry and itch take a break for a day or 2 and moisturize. Benzoyl will dry your skin out as thats how it cleans it. Amazing product with great results.",5

Helped my long term cystic acne",5.0,"I have tried everything over the years to treat my cystic acne - spot treatments, face washes, changing pillowcases and diets, the whole nine yards. After using this product 1-2 times daily, I noticed my acne reduce by 50% minimum, I’d say more like a 75-85% reduction, and it helps prevent it too. My left side of my face is now down to one spot, where it would normally have 5-8 minimum. I recommend pairing this with a moisturizer because over time if you use it 2-3 times daily it can cause a little dryness, just slow down if it does. It might cause slight irritation in the first few days-week of use, but stick with it and you will be very happy you did. I also use their other product, La Roche-Posay Effaclar Medicated Gel Cleanser (2% salicylic acid acne medication) as my daily face wash which has also helped immensely. Wash your face, then gently rub the spot treatment in (and then moisturize if you wish) and you will see results in 1-2 weeks maximum.",12

GET THIS NOW",5.0,"Will change your face in less than a week. I now apply it all over my face once a day the week before my period and I only get 1 pimple before my period if any at all. It is irritating, but so is every other product containing benzoyl peroxide. Love to pair this up with the Ultra Night Toleriane cream or the regular Toleriane cream to avoid irritation/dryness. Completely changed my skin after I got off birth control and started getting hormonal acne for the first time in years. I also started using Korean skincare and I broke out horribly. Used this along with the toleriane mosturizing face soap and the face cream and face improved greatly within a week. I know its expensive considering other brands have benzoyl peroxide for less than $10, but it simply does NOT work the same (dont know if its bc it has LHA).  BUY IT!!! Your skin will thank you like mine has.",6

Great replacement for Epiduo Forte",5.0,"I had fairly extreme acne that I went to a dermatologist for originally. She prescribed me Epiduo Forte which is prescription strength Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide in a cream. The stuff was my holy grail product. It made my skin smoother than it's ever been but once I moved it got hard to get the Rx refilled so I started looking for an OTC replacement.I tried countless drugs and combinations and this stuff finally worked. It's just as amazing as real Epiduo Forte.If you have sensitive skin which I do, mix it in with your moisturizer and give your skin a day off every now and then. If you get flakes from dryness use an enzyme peel like the Alba Botanicals papaya one, do not use any scrub or scrubby like thing. If you're still getting acne you can add in Adapalene via Differin daily or every other day.",4

Mask-ne is FINALLY gone!!",5.0,"I have extremely oily skin and I’ve to wear a mask at work 12+ hours a day for what seems like forever now! About 9 months ago my face decided it had enough and started to break out terribly along my cheeks.

I’ve been using this after washing my face and before moisturizer morning and night for three weeks and it is AMAZING!!It initially brought everything to the surface so it looked worse for about 10 days but my face is almost completely cleared up now. I don’t have sensitive skin, but it did dry out some areas quickly and burn very occasionally, so if you have sensitive skin using it once a day to start may be a safe bet.It also cleared up small problem areas I’ve had for years!!

The best spot treatment",5.0,"I have dealt with acne since I was about 12 years old and I have NEVER written a review for a skincare product until now. This is the absolute best spot treatment I have ever used. It truly makes a breakout look better within a few hours, and I am not over exaggerating (like I said I have never written a skincare product review before because I am never impressed with them) this truly makes zits go away incredibly fast. Yes, it can be drying if you use far too much at once (guilty) but even then it still makes the zit far less worse and gone within at least two days.

The Effaclar system is a skin savior!",5.0,"I was lucky enough to have clear skin in high school, so I never understood how awful acne really is. When I was 16, I received a Proactiv sample, liked how my skin felt, and continued to use it for years. Little did I know, hormones and acne go hand-in-hand. When I was about 21-22, I switched to a birth control implant, and that thing wreaked havoc on my entire life. I suddenly had horrible cystic acne. Not only did it make me self conscious and uncomfortable, but it was actually so painful, laying on my pillow hurt my face! To top it all off, my skin was also dry, and irritated. Proactiv did nothing. I tried every skin care line on the market for about 2-3 years, with no, or very little, results. I tried essential oils, raw honey, all natural soaps and salves, but nothing helped. I was so distressed, and frustrated. Finally, I found La Roche-Posays skin care products. Within 4 days, the inflammation decreased, the redness was fading, and my skin felt less dry. By 2 weeks, my skin was practically clear! I have been using this product for about 4 to 5 years now, and I haven't had a single outbreak, EXCEPT for the time I wanted to try a different product to save money. Huge mistake, one I will not make again. I get compliments on my skin regularly, and I feel confident not wearing makeup. Give this system a chance!",4

So impressed!!",5.0,My skin is pretty sensitive and i’ve been on accutane 2 times but nothing worked. My acne always would come back angrier each time. I started to use this skin routine and my face IS PERFECT. ( I also avoid drinking dairy and eating too much fast food or foods with too much oils and sugars ) Stress is a cause of acne so always meditate and avoid feeling stressed because that will cause breakouts.Morning Routine :1.

FINALLY AT PEACE WITH MY ACNES/BLACKHEADS/WHITEHEADS/CLOGGED PORES/EXCESSIVE OILY SKIN!",5.0,"For years I have used helplessly all kinds of skin/acne products, trying to fight and improve my oily skin with large pores that would clog constantly and I got to a point that I simply gave up and accepted my face would be always oily with clogged pores. And then I read an article that said most of the products try to solve the clogged pores/blackhead problems on the surface, while the truth is that the real problem is underneath the surface of the skin, and 95% of cleanser and acne treatment products do nothing to fight the real problem! (Here is the link if you like to check it out yourself http://www.acne.org/messageboard/topic/332046-the-story-of-clogged-pores/) Finally I gave Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment a try, and I usually don't leave reviews on products unless they are really great, and since the second day I saw a great improvement of how clear my skin felt, and today is the 2nd week I am using it and what this product has done in 2 weeks, I haven't been able to do in 10+ years. Skin is clear, pores are smaller, stubborn blackheads are reduced by 80% (since my pores are large around my cheeks, nose, and forehead, they will keep getting clogged as it's natural given the enlarged size of my pores) and it feels great to not have to constantly scratch or pick your face after a warm shower to get rid of some of the gunk on your face. Finally happy with a product that is very affordable and there is no need to spend $100 or more per treatment at a professional SPS or dermatologist.",6

After 14 years of suffering finally found something that works.",5.0,"It works extremely well. Ive tried everything the past 14 years to treat my hormonal acne and nothing worked. Ive had acne from age 13 to now, I am 28. Just ordered this last week been using for 5 days and havent broke out since. Just make sure you use a moisturizer after wards. I use Bag Balm because its natural and doesnt make me break out. Anywau my routine is when I wake up I dont wash my face unless its really dirty. Just put on the Effaclar where you get your breakouts and then only moisturize after with a face lotion of your choice after if you notice redness or drying. Let it stay on during the whole day and then at night before bed wash it off with just warm water and a wash cloth. Do not put effaclar on at night , and moisturize at night if needed. Morning time dont wash your face just put on the effaclar , moisturize if needed and repeat theses steps day in and day out. Thought I should share my story cause nothing has worked for me and this regimen has. Hope someone else reads this and this works from them cause I went through hell with my acne. Lost literally everything I ever wanted. But yall know what I mean the ones who went through it. Peace....",8

Super product",5.0,"I suffer from adult acne, not extremly bad but annoying and aggravating non the less.  Small bumps, not all are red and inflamed but sometimes those come through too.  So I've been on YouTube watching beauty guru's and how they cover when i came across a ""favorites"" video, this was one of her favorites, I've purchased everthing else so thought why not give it a try. Note this has 5.5% benzoyl peroxide so it is a little drying (but not tremondusly).  I started using it twice a day (too much for my skin) so now i only use it at night.  I saw results the next day.  Seriously.  Don't get me wrong, my skin is still healing, but i absoultely think this is the reason the bumps aren't red and small skin colored bumps are reduced.  I still use my day cream, Estee Lauder, and still use all my cleansers with my Clarisonic, (Cetaphyll, Dermalogica Skin Clearing) and regular eye makup remover...I really love this product, my skin is smoother and clearer than it's been for a very long time.  I've been using this for 2 weeks and really love it and will continue to use it. Note it was a bit drying but that's what needs to happen to dry out the blemishes (though Personally, if something is too drying I don't think this is good either) I also think that ""purging"" is BS - if your skin breaks out from a product you shouldn't use it THIS DID NOT HAPPEN with this product, purging means your skin is not happy and I don't think that's a sign of a good product.  Hope this review helps, if you're struggling this might help you.",4

Staple in my routine!",5.0,"This product is a staple in my morning and night face washing routine! I honestly don't know where I would be without it. It seems to keep my breakouts at bay, and if I happen to get the stray breakout here or there (hormonal acne is a beast...), this will help to dry it up so much faster than anything else (usually within about three days, even for the biggest and ugliest of cystic hormonal pimples).I have very sensitive skin and found that when I first started using this, I suffered from extreme dryness and some redness of my face. Now that I have been using it for a while and found a good moisturizer, I'm much better off. It still dries out my t-zone a bit, but I'm just sure to have a little extra moisturizer on hand for if I ever get a little bit flaky during the day and I'm good! Besides, it's definitely worth the dryness to have the assurance of much clearer skin.It will bleach your clothes/pillowcase/towels/etc.., so wash your hands after use and make sure it's fully dried on your face before your press anything against it!For the record, I have been using the one that's ""Made in the USA"" for quite a while and it's worked for me. I just wanted to be clear about that because there has been some debate in the comments about the USA vs. France version.",3

It’s worth a try I promise!! (see update)",5.0,"If you have issues picking at your skin and/or have a bunch of smaller red/white bumps as your acne, I definitely recommend. A big problem for me was just the bacteria on my face and constantly touching it and spreading it. I still struggle with picking at my face but this product has helped SO much.Update: Still using this product 2 years later. It’s the only product I know I can rely on for acne. One *very important* tip - if it burns your skin you are probably overusing it!! You only need a small small amount, don’t apply it like moisturizer. When you start using it, do not use it daily right away. You have to get your skin used to it. If it burns your skin, take a short break from using it and when you start again use it less.",38

EFFECTIVE ZIT ZAPPER",5.0,"This was recommended by my dermatologist  for a stubborn zit on my neck.The main ingredient, Benzoyl Peroxide, is a very effective antiseptic but it is also quite irritating to some people's skin-including mine.

Cleared a Year Old Blackhead",5.0,Omg. Graphic but I need to tell you how well this works. I have had a blackhead in my cheek for maybe the last year. It looks like a freckle under makeup - like that visible. My dermatologist gave me a face wash that is 10% glycolic acid and 2% salicylic acid. That has certainly helped my acne overall and some other blackheads. I even started using a glycolic acid serum. I also love tea tree masks for my acne. But nothing would make *this* blackhead budge.I’ve had Effaclar Duo for TWO DAYS and I noticed tonight my skin seemed ready to let this blackhead go! I was able to easily extract it!! I kept looking in the mirror and shaking my head. Just floored. I thought my derm was going to have to make a cut to get it out. It looks like it was NEVER there. Holy crap. I’m in love.,34

Oily skin",5.0,"I have had adult acne for as long as i remember. Nothing works. I discovered this product about 5 years ago and its the only thing that actually TREATS acne. Please trust me, you need to be consistent with this product.This product is excellent for spot treatment, and for leaving it over night. If you decide to leave it over night, dont use a blob. A light coating is enough due to the fact that this product absorbs so perfectly that youll forget sometimes whether you covered a spot or not lol.Tips:If you MUST wear make up on a problem spot like i sometimes do when i go out, then use a light coating to spot treat. Let it absorb then apply make up over it.If leaving overnight, Make sure to wash off in the morning and follow up with a moisturizer that works for you, i personally like the mary kay clear proof since it also absorbs rapidly and does not feel greasy on my skin.Please moisturize! This product will dry your skin, and as good as it sometimes feels to not feel oily it is just as bad. Dry skin will make you break out again.To wash off i use their same brand, the foaminng gel with PH balance.",3

BENZOYL PEROXIDE WARNING",5.0,"5 stars because this is at no fault of a product (and i've heard amazing things) but if you have sensitive skin please DO NOT use this! Many people with sensitive skin are allergic to BENZOYL PEROXIDE and since the concentration is so high, it can get really bad. I failed to read that it has benzoyl peroxide and ended up with a really bad allergic reaction that lasted for days and am still having to put vaseline on my face to remedy the extreme dryness it caused.

Its about 2.5% and they tell you that you do need to use A LOT which I've done for a long time.

I found this product actually recommended on an acne.org forum so I thought I would try it.  I followed instructions and only used a pea size amount on my whole face (about 5 times as less product as the acne.org 2.5 BZ) and literally the next morning my skin was 90% clear.  I couldn't believe it. Keep in mind that this product has over twice as much BZ into than acne.org's so expect a little drying until you get used to it.  I'm completely sold!

Effective and Gentle",5.0,"I have difficult skin to treat--delicate and sensitive, plus I have both rosacea and acne. Try to treat the acne, and I get all red and irritated. Treat the rosacea, and I break out with acne.  I discovered Effaclar cream cleanser a little over a year ago, and my skin has been so much better. But I still had some breakouts from time to time, and I wanted to treat them so they would clear up fast. I tried Duo, and I am hooked.I find this very effective, but very gentle. One application is all I need to take care of a breakout. And while this is 5.5% benzoyl peroxide, the preparation makes it gentler than the former 2.5% formula of another brand I used to use. I don't know what their secret is (they say it is micronized) but I can use it on my delicate skin and not end up dry, red, and flaky. I only use this for spots, so I can't speak to how it would be applied all over your face. But problems spots aren't problems any more. Highly recommended.",4

Holy Grail Product",5.0,"I would recommend this product to anyone with problems with acne who tried everything and didn't have luck with other products. All of a sudden I got horrible (for me) acne that I wanted gone quickly. My usual skincare routine was not fixing the problem. My main medication for acne was Epiduo. That worked for my very light hormonal acne, but it wasn't strong enough for this particular flare up. I turned to Youtube, and I found videos done by a few of my favorite Youtubers that recommended this product for fast results when they had moments of bad acne. I was desperate so I ordered it. BEST DECISION! This is a very harsh product and I would only use it as a spot treatment making sure to avoid the skin around my spots because it is extremely drying. In the first two days, I saw definite healing and improvement. Each day my spots were less red, smaller in size, and hurt less. I would say that within 4-7 days I was back to my normal skin. I was applying this multiple times a day. It was such a relief. This isn't a product that I need everyday anymore, but it will be the first thing I reach for when I notice little spots forming.",14

I LOVE LA ROCHE POSAY",5.0,"La Roche Posay is an absolute life saver. I never had acne as a teenager but for some reason as an adult I got TERRIBLE acne. Huge, red, deep painful acne that left dark red marks. I'm not a vain person but there were some days I'd just break down and cry. I didn't want to commit to using anything prescription though because I was not a fan of the side effects. In December 2014 I started using this line after a recommendation from a friend. My skin, less than a year later (within a month already huge improvements) is PERFECT. I still get the occasional pimple but it's very small and doesn't leave a mark and usually only comes around my cycle. I recommend this to everyone, it's absolutely completely worth the price and a little goes a long way.The only advice I'd have is get a really good night creamer because it is a bit drying. As long as you use a good moisturizer at night and really give it at least 3 months to work you will not regret it!",3

Works Better Than Other Products",5.0,"I have had acne for a long time probably over ten years. I have tried different treatments including neutrogena and pro active. I have pretty sensitive skin, but it could be worse. I can tell you this product will dry you out, especially at first, but if you get a moisturizer and use it diligently you shouldn't suffer from this dryness for long (i use Simple for about $10-$13 depending on where you buy it).I get zits on the lower half of my cheeks and chin a lot. occasionally in other places but it is rare. I break out around my period and the zits are big and painful. If you have these problems this product is perfect. It lessens pain and size of the zits drastically and can get completely rid of them in like a day or two. It truly is a blessing.Make sure you order it from the states. One time I ordered it from the Greek marketplace because it was cheaper and it messed my face up and took a while for the states product to start working on my skin again after I used the Greek marketplace product.",3

Great for Mild Acne with Consistent Use",5.0,"I've been using this product for several years, and I've never been disappointed. It diminishes pimples gently over a few days, and my skin never gets flaky or dry. For reference, I'm 46 with oily skin, but my skin can get get dry with regular benzoyl peroxide. In addition, if left to its own devices, my face will break out with cystic acne. Not a lot, but enough. This product keeps it smooth and pimples to a minimum.  I know, because when I run out and try to use something else to save money, I inevitably break out once again. When I start using it again, I do use it morning and night to get the breakout under control, and then I can go back to nightly application. As long as you're not sensitive to BP, which is why some may have not had good luck with this product, this cream really does help mild to moderate acne.",18

Amazing product!",5.0,"This has been a game-changer for me. I've had acne (including cystic) since I was a teenager (now 27) and never found anything that helped until now. At first I just used it as a spot treatment on problem areas. I've been using it for about 3 months, and the problem areas I had have completely healed, and the scarring is even fading too! Now I just mix in a little bit of the product with my moisturizer morning and evening. I still get the occasional tiny breakout, but it's usually completely gone within a day. Two words of caution: first, it's strong, so don't use too much. When I first got it, I put a thin layer over my whole face and got a nice chemical burn. When that healed though, the acne was less pronounced, so I decided to try it again carefully in smaller amounts, and it worked great! Second, it will discolor fabrics, so be cautious about what touches your face after using it. Overall though, this is a great product and I completely recommend it!",0

Works like a charm",5.0,"I have been using this stuff for almost 3 months, and it has made a huge difference in my face. I suffered from awful acne during pregnancy and it decided to hang around even after I gave birth. When my regular skin care products failed, I turned to this and I’m so glad I did. I went from a face full of stubborn pimples to 95% clear skin (minus scarring) over the course of a couple of months. I started out using twice a day and then went down to once daily when the acne was mostly cleared. Since using it my skin has also become less oily and less textured. Only downside is if I forget to put it on, my skin kindly reminds me by breaking out again. But that’s my fault, not the products lol. Overall I’m hooked and highly recommend.",21

After years of searching, I found the perfect acne ointment",5.0,"I've been using this daily for a couple years now and love it! I started getting it as a recommendation from a dermatologist and I've never been happier. Unlike other acne ointments which irritate or dry out the skin, this one prevents breakouts and keeps it moisturized! It's an essential part of my skincare routine now and is perfect for my sensitive skin. It might not work as well for all skin types, but for my skin type (oily) can't recommend it enough!",0

Acne Treatment Miracle",5.0,This really works.  My daughter was struggling with blackheads and nothing we used was working.  My daughter is a preteen and I read it was sensitive for all skins.  She used it morning and night and could see improvement by the next day.  It completely dissolves the blackheads and this is the clearest her skin has ever been without experiencing any over-drying or negative side effects.  She only used it for the few days she needs it.  I would recommend if you're struggling with blackheads and everything else seems to not be working.,0

Acne free at last!!!",5.0,"I suffered with acne all my life. I am 38 now and I will say that I never used a product that show results this fast. My last outbreak started in july 2016 and finally after having tried everything and anything that was recommended to me,in feb 2017 I decided to go to the dermatologist. She gave me a regimen of antibiotics (doxycycline hycla 100mg and a cream named clindamycin. I used the cream for 2 weeks and finished the 30 days regimen of antibiotics. The reason I stopped the cream is because I discover effaclar duo. True it might not be for everyone but it WORKED for me. I am thankful to the cousin, who saw me and knew my suffering being that she was herself suffering from acne, recommended that I tried it.It's been 24 days and my acne have vanished.I shopped for the other products made Laroche Posay.",2

This stuff really works!",5.0,"Make sure you are not allergic to benzoyl peroxide. This treatment works for my skin so this review will be based on my experience. Just for a brief background, I've been using benzoyl peroxide for awhile. I started with 2.5% then adjusted to 5.5% because I got better results. However, I don't recommend going to 5.5% right away.This stuff really works! I like it because it dries quickly, unlike other gel type treatments where you have to wait a few minutes before applying other creams/lotions. It prevents breakouts (you'll probably see one or two) and clears out the ones that you do have. I've tried other treatments with the same main ingredient, this is definitely my favorite. This will dry up your skin so make sure that you moisturize after and exfoliate your skin once in awhile. Otherwise,  you'll end up with flaky dry skin which might cause acne. I also recommend using a mild face wash.",0

Best acne product ever!",5.0,Used in conjunction with their cleanser! Get pair. My review for the cleanser is below. Great acne products. Works amazingThis product is amazing! I used so many products for my hormonal cystic acne over the years and nothing helped. My dermatologist said only acutane would help me and I wasn’t exactly on board with that option. So I tried this as a last resort and I am so happy I did. It says it takes 10 days to work and I started seeing results in 2! My acne is almost all the way gone and my pretty clear skin is back. It doesn’t dry my skin out but gets rid of my pimples. It’s worth every penny,3
