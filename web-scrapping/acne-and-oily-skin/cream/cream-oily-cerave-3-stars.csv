doesn't do much for those with oily skin",3.0,"a lot of skincare products are marketed towards those with dry skin. however, i have super oily skin and sebaceous filaments on my nose and bought this with the assumption that it would help subside those issues. upon putting the product on, it's thick and kind of tacky and it DOES have a scent and it smells really strong and bad. using some kind of fan to dry your face helps and once it dries it doesn't smell anymore. i've been using this product for about a month now. sometimes i'd use it up to three times a day, sometimes i'd use it every other day. i would always use it after washing my face with cerave face wash. however, it didn't do anything at all to help my oily skin. it didn't make it better nor did it make it worse. i'm neutral towards this product since i already bought it to try it out and will continue using it until it runs out (probably as a plaecbo effect) but i won't be rebuying. for those seeking to use this to control oily skin, i wouldn't recommend this product.",4

Not the Best",3.0,I‚Äôve tried all the acne products on the market with little to no luck. As this brand his highly recommended by dermatologists I decided to give it a try. I used it in combination with the acne control face wash. After two months I noticed no change and moved to differin. I found that product more helpful.,2

Didn‚Äôt really help",3.0,I have bad pregnancy acne right now and it did not really help. I applied it all over and I wouldStill get new breakouts. It worked for the first few days but then stopped. It is gentle on my skin though and not over drying so I still try to mix it in with my face routine . Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again though .,0

Very bad with my skin",3.0,"After reading everything about it, I thought it sounded great and would be perfect for my skin. I haven‚Äôt had problems with my face because I take really good care of it. However, maybe I am to blame because I was trying to save money. I‚Äôm guessing it was possibly an allergic reaction to it. I‚Äôve never had this happen before. I hope it works for you if you choose to try it.",0

Not sure",3.0,"Maybe, I didn‚Äôt use the product long enough to get results. I bought this on the name, and reviews. It‚Äôs clear, no smell, works for sensitive skin, it does not cause purging, it does not cause more acne bumps to form. I can‚Äôt say anything negative.  As this product appeared to work for many. I do not think it worked for me, and this review is based on using the product for one month.",2

Its ok",3.0,"I haven't used this long enough to see how well it works....but I will say this product will cause MAJOR skin purging. The ingredients in this (aha and bha) are skin resurfacing ingredients. So all the gunk in your skin will surface at once and will cause your acne to be WORSE. With that said, it takes about 2 weeks to 2 months for skin purging to end so try and stick it out to reap the benefits. I'm only 2 weeks in but hoping it gets better soon",105

Works well, but‚Ä¶",3.0,"This product works very well for my acne. I have sensitive skin and it does not bother my skin at all. The one thing that is a negative but also a positive is, it will pull ALL blackheads to the surface of your skin. It will look like you have dirt all over your skin.

Takes a long time work and dries face.",3.0,I was really excited for this product and happened to have a nasty pimple when it arrived. It took about a week for my pimple to go away even with using the spot treatment every single day. It did leave the skin around my pimple very dry and flaky.  I have used products that get rid of zits overnight. Very disappointed.,0

Didn‚Äôt work for my difficult skin",3.0,The product got three stars because it did seem to help prevent new acne. It did not even phase the acne I do have. It dies quick without noticeable residue. Differin gel treats my acne. I was just looking for a cheaper treatment. Good luck.,0

Fast working but leaves blemishes",3.0,"I need a product that doesn‚Äôt leave scarring. This dries out my hormonal acne without drying my face out, but it doesn‚Äôt actually help prevent acne. It just speeds up the process of the pimples, so they go away faster. I probably will switch back to tretinoin because the scarring on my face has gotten so bad.",0

Somewhat effective spot acne treatment",3.0,Pimples just grows over night for me and I have been using Peter Thomas Roth goodbye acne complete treatment which has been working very well. I came across this and wanted to give it a try because it has salicylic acid which is the active ingredient for acne. Some days I notice that it work and reduced the inflammation and pimple and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt really do much. I find that it works on smaller acne and not so much on bigger ones. Also don‚Äôt recommend putting it on the skin if the surface barrier is destroyed because it can sting.,0

Works sometimes",3.0,This acne spot treatment is pretty nice but doesn‚Äôt always work for me. I find that it works best on small pimples and reduces the size of the pimple but doesn‚Äôt really work on larger ones. I still use it to apply daily and see some results in my acne. I would recommend not to apply this is open wounds ( like a popped pimple) because it will burn!,0

Not for sensitive skin, way too strong",3.0,"This is not for sensitive skin. Please be careful. I used it for the first time on my skin, which is super sensitive. I did follow it by moisturizer and SPF 50 as instructed, but still the next day it burnt my face. Luckily I did a spot only, not the large area on my face otherwise I could not believe how bad my face will be.I have to use Aloe vera on that area and a lot of hydration cream and HA serum. It's red and starts peeling.So just make sure to blot test it on your skin first before using it on the face.",2

Don‚Äôt notice a difference",3.0,"This CeraVe Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Gel was available to me through the Amazon Vine program.

However, since doesn‚Äôt like to talk to me about such things, I don‚Äôt know exactly how regularly he is using it.  (Instructions state to use up to 3x/day.)  This product is made in the USA.",0
