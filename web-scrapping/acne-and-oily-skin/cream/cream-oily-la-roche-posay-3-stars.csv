Not what I hoped for",3.0,"I recently purchased this after hearing a lot of hype about it, but unfortunately, I had a negative experience with it. After using the cream for a few days, I noticed that my skin was breaking out even more than usual. At first, I thought it was just a temporary purging phase, but it didn't seem to be getting any better.I understand that some of these creams can cause purging as they work to clear out impurities in the skin, but the breakouts I experienced were more severe than I was comfortable with. I had to stop using the cream and switch back to my usual skincare routine.On a positive note, I will say that the cream did seem to work well on the pimples that had already formed. They were smaller and less red after using the cream, which was promising. However, the negative side effects outweighed the positive for me.Overall, I would caution others to do their research before purchasing, and to be aware of the potential for purging.",7

BE careful",3.0,This really helps with blackheads. I had blackheads on my nose and some were gone the next day. And these were really deep deeeeep blackheads btw. But i tried using this on some whiteheads and colorless bumps. but it really dried out ym skin and made my skin worse than ever. Just be careful and figure out the problem you're having with your skin before purchasing.,0

It works",3.0,"I got this in France, and will be purchasing this again online. The acid ingredients helps to unclog pores more effectively than using an acne needle, and I do notice an improvement in my oily, acne-prone skin's huge pores. It won't fix the problem completely, of course. (my skin doctor told me that the pore/blackhead problem is almost unsolvable... ugh!) But it does help. I use this only at nighttime, and use Chanel's Le Blanc moisturizer mixing with Philosophy's Vitamin C powder in the morning. While I always wake up with oily, greasy face in the morning, this product helps a lot in controlling the oily situation. It's not magic, but the active ingredients really works. It's light and almost gel-like, so it feels great on my oily skin (I personally hate all heavy creams). It's less irritating than Avene's Triacnel, which I purchased in the same drugstore in the same time but gave up because it's too harsh on my skin.So overall..Pros:- light, non-greasy;- not too harsh, not drying;- nice smell, not perfumed, nor repelling;- affordable.Cons:- not super-magical-stuff. It helps, but may not change your skin. The change may be too insignificant on skins with serious acne problems.- mine become watery when it went to 1/3 left... I can still use it, but every time while shaking it I just secretly doubt if it's still okay.- sticky after application. So better used on clean skin as the last procedure of skin care. It meddles with my sunscreen, so I have to use it only in evenings.LATER ADDED:I purchased this again on Amazon, and to my surprise I didn't know that there are 2 versions of this product. The US version is consisted of 5% BP and it's not recommended to use over the whole face. I tried to find the made-in-France version but didn't see any online. So disappointed. I'm only looking for something that's mild and will gently make my acne-prone skin look better, not something harsh & drying, though fairly effective. The French version was simply a unclogging formula that can be used on a daily basis. Too bad that mine is running out. I guess this page is for the US version. It's fine but I'll only use it for emergencies.",3

Nothing special...just a really strong benzoyl peroxide",3.0,"Apparently there are two formulations of effaclar duo.  The rave reviews online are all for the international version (Made in France) which you can wear as a daily lotion all over your to treat and prevent acne.  I tried several websites that either didnt deliver overseas or had exorbitant shipping fees, so I had to settle to trying out this version.  The version sold here is Made in America and has completely difference ingredients from the international one.  This is basically just a 5.5% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment.  I used to use neutrogena on-the-spot treatment which is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and found it to be grainy and ineffective.  This product is alot stronger and will dry out your skin.  BE VERY CAREFUL when using this.I havent had acne problems in a few years, but after a recent trip to the northeast, I developed a patch of cystic acne on one cheek.  I was careful to use this as a spot treatment. The cream is white, smooth and dries invisibly.  After the first night, I didn't notice any changes.  The second night I applied it again and after 30min my skin started to burn. I immediately washed it off, applied some moisturizer, and went to bed.  The next morning, my right cheek had a bright red chemical burn in the coin-sized shaped of the area on which I had applied this treatment.  My acne does feel slightly smaller (after all benzoyl peroxide is supposed to kill bacteria), but I can barely tell with all the pain and inflammation left behind. Maybe with chronic use, my skin will adapt... will update if I find a better way to use this!",3

No",3.0,"This is one of my least favorite la roche posay products, it literally does nothing, if anything it just made my skin red and made my pimples pop out more and it did nothing for my skin. I use the entire line and this has never been on my like list but after the reviews I decided to try it again to cut out another product I was using for small bumps and pimples. Do not waste your money. Been using for a month and no difference but all the other products I use by them are amazing! Btw this kinda burns and irritates your skin, would not suggest for sensitive skin. Definitely not moisturizing, it‚Äôs not a sheer liquid it‚Äôs a semi thick lotion type of product.",2

Mostly does what it claims",3.0,"I have always had skin issues, especially one very annoying week a month. I bought this after reading other reviews and I am mostly happy I have stayed with it (I have combination skin and am 25 years old). The first two weeks I used it, it made my skin very dry, which I would only realize when I applied make-up on top of it. However after getting over that bump I definitely can see my skin has gotten used to it. I use it as a spot treatment and the results vary. It is in no way a miracle worker but it does clear up problem areas over the course of a few days, for me at least. I have been breaking out less but I am always testing out a variety of products, still searching for the miracle combination. I also bought this a few months ago and still have a significant amount left. I use it a few times a week so it lasts awhile as a spot treatment. Will most likely purchase again because it does what it says on my acne. However it also claims to improve pores/blackheads (my problem area for that is my nostrils/end of my nose) and I have not seen much improvement regarding that.",0

Effective spot treatment -- very irritating, use it sparingly!",3.0,"This is an effective spot treatment, but I have to use it very sparingly. I noticed that cystic pimples and whiteheads dried up and went away more quickly than if left to their own devices. It didn't help prevent new pimples, though. It also is VERY irritating on sensitive skin, so I only used it at most about 2-3x a week -- any more than that and my skin would get very dry. You def have to moisturize with this (and you should anyway)!I also had issues with this causing intense redness and itchiness on my neck and around my eyelids, like a rash, even though I was very careful not to put product there. I realized that my moisturizer was moving it around to those areas, so I started applying this AFTER moisturizing my neck and eye area, and then just patting some moisturizer on top after the spot treatment. That helped. I've also read you can actually wash off benzoyl peroxide treatments after 10 min and they're still effective, so that's what I'll try the next time I have a bad zit. Also yes it bleached my towels.",6

It works, but it BURNS.",3.0,"I had high hopes for this product. Just a quick background about my skin type, I have an extremely sensitive skin, acne, red- prone skin. It gets irritated very easily. I don't have a lot of acne, just a few hormonal acne around my cheeks and more acne scars on my chin and jaw line. I used this as a spot treatment at night. It BURNS. My face was so red. It felt like it was peeling off and very itchy. The next couple of days, where I put the cream, it started peeling off. I assumed this must be working because it hurts. I am not sure if i am hurting my skin or just letting the product do the job. But I have to say, i noticed a bit of a difference, not huge, but I believe it's working, very slowly though.

Average",3.0,"I've been using this product for about a month thus far. When I made the purchase, my expectations were rather high given the cost, however, I haven't noticed anything special about it. I'd say it's a decent product, but at the same time, I don't know how it compares with other products within the same price range.

The products are good and altogether do wonders for my skin, keeping it pimple and blemish free. However, if one runs out of one out of the three products, the results differ. After running out of my cleanser, I realized that my skin is a lot more oily than before I used the products which frustrates me. By this point, the cream has no effect.

helps acne but has problems in bleaching",3.0,a relatively good acne treatment which I use 2x a day. I have sensitive skin and even the most gentle products will sometimes cause an eruption. this product mostly  keeps it in check. Not a perfect cure as I still have some white heads which after long use have been reduced in size but cleared up. The big down side is that this product can stain and take the color out of anything it comes in contact with. So wash your hands afterwards and then apply a gentle moisturized. Otherwise there will be bleached spots on your pillow case or clothes.,9

not bad for price",3.0,I bought this product because I have tried a million others that don't work. First off I don't have bad acne I just have places that are coming up more often. When I first put this product on it burned like fire but once my skin adjusted to it that didnt happen anymore. It does seem to help some and for the price its worth a try.,0

Works instantly but harsh on akin",3.0,"I don‚Äôt have a lot of acne but for a sudden breakout that would not go away. Out of desperation I decided to try this product because I was just fed up.I do have mild Rosacea and therefore I‚Äôm very cautious and would not normally put anything harsh on my skin. My Rosacea is into in my cheeks. The same place of the current breakout. Therefore I was very weary so I tried just one spot and after an our I noticed my pimple was gone! BUT my skin was very red like I had a rosacea outbreak.Therefore, proceed with caution. It works but you may get a rash/burning/redness/dryness.It‚Äôs so strong it even says on the back that your akin can get irritated. Be forewarned.",0

Maybe it is the benoxyl. We may need to try other acid like salicylic or whatever that's not benoxyl or adapalene.

Drying....Definitely not a miracle worker for me....",3.0,"I know the best way to have clear skin(at least for me) is to eat healthy and cut out sugar and heavily processed foods. I'm working on getting back to that way of eating, but in the mean time, I'm paying the consequences.Sometimes I think this *might* be helping a tiny bit, and other times I'm convinced it only makes things worse. It hasn't worked any miracles, for sure. It has dried my skin out horribly, though. If you try it, make sure you start out slowly. It made my skin peel due to the drying, and it's not pretty at all, especially if putting make-up over that dry skin.",3

Expensive but effective: use sparingly",3.0,"This is an effective treatment for moderate acne, but definitely more expensive than a lot of more common over the counter brands and it is basically the same thing: benzoyl peroxide is the main ingredient. This woks fine, but there are cheaper options. I have a small reaction to this treatment: it makes my skin irritated and red when applied, but it goes away within an hour, and does treat the pimple. I only use this sparingly and directly on the spot needing treatment.",0

Works, but dried out my skin",3.0,"I had received this and wanted to try it to see if I could get rid of a few problem areas that would not clear up.  While the one area did clear for the most part in a day or two, it REALLY made that area dry out to the point of it peeling and flaking. Thank goodness I did not put this on my entire face. I put an Avon moisturizer on and used this once in the morning in hopes that it would help, but it did not.  Now, I am not using it at all, just the moisturizer and it is still super dry and flaky in those areas even several days later with no use.  I do not have sensitive skin, or dry skin in general on my face.  I am in the combo area.  I would say, if you can get a sample of this product, try to get one first and use on a small area to see how well it works with your skin before getting a larger tube.  Wish this would have worked better for me like it did with so many others.",0

Too strong for me",3.0,"I know my skin to be fairly sensitive, so I tried using just a dot on the problem area.  It dried it up pretty quickly but then I also peeled, which lasted another two days and was just as unsightly.There's not much I can do about that, so this isn't going to be for me, and I can't speak to whether it will help prevent future breakouts.For me it's a 3 star, since it did work.
