**Updated Review - Finally got results!!",4.0,"***UPDATE*** Even after my previous review where I expressed my disappointment, I continued using this product on my breakouts because I figured, ""Why the heck not? Can't make things worse and I can use all the help I can get"" lol. Well this product FINALLY starting working for me after about 11 or 12 days. I made my initial review within the first week. I read MANY reviews of people having results overnight or within a few days so when I didn't have quick results, I thought this product had failed me. HOWEVER! I'm assuming my breakouts were just very stubborn because they FINALLY starting clearing up on my jawline/neck area. This cream has definitely helped now with the redness and appearance of my hormonal acne. I havent had any new breakouts in the areas where I apply this either. I'm glad I didn't give up on the product because my face looks so much better now! I wish I had pictures. Apparently this product can work miraculously quick or it can end up needing some time, I think it just depends on the person and the type of acne/cause of breakouts that person has.Really disappointed with this product. I have several other Cerave products that I love so I had high hopes for this.. but I have not had any results. I've been struggling with hormonal acne on my jawline and my neck by my jaw. I've been religiously following my skin care routine (washing and moisturizing twice a day, using a retinol cream once a day, clay face mask about once a week) and can't seem to get it under control. I was really really hoping this product would work for me but it hasn't helped with current or prevented new breakouts.",25

Hydrating for an acne treatment",4.0,"This is fairly hydrating for an acne product, and whilst I haven't had any new breakouts whilst using this, I was hoping it would work well for my blackheads, but I haven't seen any results there. I like the mix of actives included in it and so will continue using it under a moisturizer, but sadly it does pill (my pet peeve!). I have combination skin with an oily t-zone for reference, and when I use this alone I do find my skin overproduces oil, so using with a moisturizer is key for me. I probably won't reorder (unless it starts to magically perform blackhead miracles), but it's gentle and brightening so I'll use it until I run out!",4

Great so far",4.0,"I gotta say I could definitely see a big difference in my skin a few days after i started using this, however I started breaking out bad once again which could just be hormones. The scent is not the best but its not unbearable. It leaves a sticky feeling once it dries on your skin but its not a problem after your skin finally absorbs all of it",2

Works unbelievably well",4.0,After one use the gel dried up the new pimples. I was surprised at how quickly it worked. The only thing I don't like is the slightly chemically scent which fades quickly as the gel dries up. It takes longer to work on older pimples though.,0

Not bad",4.0,"I have been using this for a month now and I must say it does clear up existing acne and reduces pimples! However, the texture is weird it takes a lot of rubbing and the smell is odd. But besides that, I’m liking it so far CeraVE is my new favorite skincare brand.",6

Its alright but expensive",4.0,I started using this over the weekends only. It seems nice and easy to apply and glide onto the skin. I am not sure if i will see some improvements into my skin because i use other products on my face like Vitamin C & retinol at night. So far my skin has improved a lot being a guy. I will definitely test out a different similar  product before repurchasing this again. This seems to be on a expensive side too!,0

Review",4.0,"I quite like it, but I would recommend shaking the product before use, it’s quite runny. I know it states no fragrance, but I couldn’t help but be reminded of pancake syrup after use... Overall, it’s slightly tacky but with time it mattifies. It doesn’t really feel like a true gel cream that I’ve used, for example Shiseido, but it doesn’t cause my makeup to pill. Since this product is new I am not sure about long term results, but I have no breakouts so far.",40

prefer to use as part of nightly skincare routine",4.0,"I've used the CeraVe Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Gel for Face for about 2 weeks now. I don't have a ton of breakouts but a few blemishes here and there that I wanted to test this out as more of a preventative care product rather than treating current issues. I think it works fairly well on my combination skin in preventing/minimizing breakouts.After washing your face, you apply a thin layer of this product one to three times daily on the areas of the face you want to treat. I prefer to only use the product once a day and I have found it works best if I apply it in the late evening, an hour or so before I go to bed. It makes my face shiny so it's not something I want to apply if I'm going to be outside the home and I don't want to put makeup on after applying it either.The gel is 1.35 fl oz.",2

GOOD FOR WHEN YOU'RE MIDDLE AGED BUT THE  ACNE NEVER WENT AWAY",4.0,"This is a multi-tasker. It treats and prevents acne, but also has benefits for skin texture. It has a slightly glue-like scent that disappears quickly and didn't bother me at all, and I am very picky about how things that go on my face smell. It is sticky and tacky upon application, but about half an hour later I don't notice it. I put it on at night for this reason.",4

The maple syrup smell is insane",4.0,"I like everything about this product except the strong maple syrup odor!  I've never experienced anything like it.Otherwise, it's affordable and not irritating to my sensitive skin.  Since it can be drying, you might want to ease into it - try it two or three times per week, then slowly increase you usage.  I apply to my chin and jawline at night where I experience hormonal acne and it seems to be helping, although I also use a topical antibiotic lotion in the morning.",0
