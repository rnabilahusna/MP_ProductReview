extremely irritating for those with sensitive skin.",1.0,"currently writing this with red, swollen cheeks thanks to this product, which is a SHOCKER because neither the toner nor the sunscreen moisturizer i’ve purchased from this company have irritated my skin so horribly before. unfortunately, this acne cream just isn’t it if you have sensitive skin like me. i have used it as both a spot corrector and on my cheek area, both to the same outcome of burning itchy discomfort. expect itching, drying, and red puffy skin. no idea how i’m going to fix this and i’m furious my cheeks are this way now after how beautiful my skin had gotten but suffice it to say i’m extremely disappointed.",2

DO NOT BUY",1.0,"I never write reviews but im not even kidding you please do not buy this product. I got super excited after buying this  and decided to try it and it went pretty well after the first few times. Then after a bit  MY FACE STARTED BURNING I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO OMGG I HATE THIS PRODUCT. My face was burning and I tried putting on cream and ice which just aggravated it. My face was burned and left with a ton of pimples that hurt and ruined my sking. My skin has never been the same i was left with a bunch of pimpples, acne scarring and not just that but also indented scarring as well. If you do end up buying this product just be careful and do not do not use it more then they tell you.",4

DONT USE UNLESS UR GETTING HIGHER DOSE OF BENZOYL PEROXIDE",1.0,"if you got burned or got blisters or somthing happed to ur face read this and me too!! do not use this product unless u are used to it and need to get a lever higher but you aren’t really supposed to be using 5% more like 1-2.5% and this one is 5% but iv seen it work on people maybe you just need to work your way up and start with low dose. since i ddint do my research my face was completely fine once i put it on but i woke up next morning my face was swollen,itchy and red and felt like i burned i wasint having so much on an allergic reaction more like a irritation and i finnaly did my research and turns out u have to wait 1-3 days for it to calm down and make sure ur face if moisturized im bearly starting to heal i iced my face after location and stay out of the sun for a long period of time",2

Terrible! Rash! Burnt my skin!",1.0,This product is horrible. I’ve used other products from the skin line so I thought I would give this a try. I have red patches that itch and burn all over… literally anywhere that I put a dab at had a huge reaction that I’m still dealing with.,0

Allergic reaction after two days of using.",1.0,"My skin is not sensitive and I’ve never had a reaction like this ever in my life. I started to get a rash on my chin and I used one of my makeup remover wipes then it got worse. The makeup remover wipe spread the product all over my face and now my whole face is swollen and itchy. Again, my face is not sensitive. I’ve used many products in my life. This product did some damage in two days and I’ve been treating for over a week now. My chin feels dry and hard. The rest of my face feels irritated and I have a rash all over. The heat and cold easily irritates my skin. Benadryl barely helps with the swelling and I feel like it’s healing slowly. I do not recommend. I have uploaded my face after using the product, before using the product and what it did to my towel after rubbing the product off my face. This cream is bleaching the pores and not actually minimizing them. Waste of money and not worth it. Do your skin a favor and purchase a different product that is safe.",9

My face is burned",1.0,"Please listen to the other 1 star reviews. I’ve be using it for 3 days and the other reviews said that it would burn at first. I didn’t see any irritation at first, only the burning. Day 3 I used it lightly like always. My face is BURNED and BRIGHT RED. I will never use it again and will be throwing it out. I’ve never in my life had something do this to my face. The places were I applied are painful, irritated, and feel like snake skin. I’m horrifed. Please pay attention to the other reviews, I saw them and didn’t listen. My face is ruined.",9

Did not meet my expectations and had to stop using this product",1.0,"I had a severe acne breakout recently and after researching many products, I decided to get this product based on the many positive reviews I read online.However, after trying the products for a few weeks, I had to stop using it completely as it almost left my face in a worse condition. To begin with, it caused severe dryness on my face even when I applied moisturizer. It always left my face burning severely as well and this made me so uncomfortable every time I used the product. In the process of treating the acne, this product also left big burnt scars on my face which would often not clear off until many days later.Therefore, I had to discontinue using the product.",0

Burned my skin",1.0,I use this company's products but wanted to try this item for the first time since it said it can be used on sensitive skin.  I used very little and could feel the burn right away.  I don't know what other ingredient is in this product but at least for my sensitive skin I can't use it.  I have washed my face several times and still the area where I applied this product is very red and feels uncomfortable.,0

Made my eyes sore and red—do a patch test first",1.0,Got this product as it has a lot of hype on Instagram and Tiktok. Reviews said its best for blemishes and pimple marks but you can apply it on your entire face. I dont have sensitive skin but the first application was really painful and it burned! The next day i woke up with my eyes really sore that left texture. It looked like i got beaten and its been a week the texture is still there. Please make patch test first before applying it on your face. Now im miserable,11

This is not for sensitive skin!",1.0,"The advertisement of this product says it's safe for sensitive skin--it is not.  The reverse of the packaging states ""do not use if you have very sensitive skin"". I tried it twice and both times it burned and itched to the point of me having to wash it off--and then it still itched like crazy for an hour!

Burned my teen's face!",1.0,"Followed the directions and it ended up burning my teen's face very badly! My teen's acne is not very bad, but we thought this would help spot treat things before they got out of hand. Well, that definitely didn't work! Had to see 2 doctors to treat the very painful chemical burns. It took over a month to heal. I brought the tube into the appointments and both doctors were shocked. This is definitely NOT for anyone with sensitive skin and I'm highly skeptical that the ingredients are truly at the %/proportion stated. I will never purchase this again. I did return for a full refund with no problem.",2

However, I just recently opened one of the new tubes and was surprised to find that it feels almost entirely empty?? The tube immediately deflated when I tried to use it like it was filled with air.

Burned my skin!!!!",1.0,I have used Differin Gel for so long I thought maybe it wasn't working anymore so I tried this. I didn't put much on and my skin turned red and raw by the next day. It looked as if I had burned a ring around the area I put it on and my skin felt scaly and dry as can be. No amount of moisturizer worked and had to end up putting aquaphor with a bandage over top to help get my skin back to normal. Even after all that the pimple was no different either. Never again,2

Too harsh yet not effective",1.0,"I've used other benzoyl peroxide spot treatments for years with great results but the one I usually buy wasn't available on amazon so I decided to try this because I like other La Roche Posay products (I've used the effaclar medicated face wash for years). However, the concentration of 5.5% BP is just way too strong. It gave me dry flakey patches when I used it on a small area, and even when I use a tiny bit on a zit, it turns the skin red. I could deal with it if it helped to shrink the zit or make it heal faster (usually my experience with BP spot treatments), but I haven't noticed any difference at all.",0

Could help acne or maybe turn into an itchy rash...",1.0,"I used this as a 3 step process.  First I used the Effaclar medicated gel acne cleanser 2x a day for about a week by itself with no problems.  Then I added the Effaclar face moisturizer in the am for 3-4 days without any issue.  Finally, I added this Duo Dual treatment cream once a day.  BIG problem.  It took 2-3 days and I had a rash all over my neck and lower jaw.  It’s been 4 days now and I am still itching but it finally is calming down a little.  I had just bragged to my husband the night before how I thought it was really helping me.  So, buyer beware.  I know everyone ‘s skin is different, so just be on the lookout that an itchy rash is a possibility!",23

This product burned so badly the first time I used it on my face that I had to wash it off, and I only used a thin layer. i tried it again after a few weeks and it barely burned at all so I used it for a few weeks, and it just did nothing for my skin. I also get ""normal"" zits on my neck for some odd reason and so I used this product on them. I swear it seemed like this stuff made them swell up and harden, it was disgusting!!

DRYING...US version is different than the original French - BEWARE",1.0,"I am used to the ""Made in France"", original version of this moisturizer. The French Effaclar Duo is the only thing that works on my face. Keeps blemishes away but does not ever dry my skin.Unfortunately, the ""Made in USA"" version has Benzoyl Peroxide 5.5% - consistency is a thick white cream, compared to a white light gel in the French version.The USA version terribly dries out my face and does not help with blemishes at all.So be beware, if you are used to the French version, this one might be way too strong.

I actually used the la roche posay suncreen in conjunction with this. By the way I actually ended up  loving the sunscreen.

The product made in France is amazing and has dramatically decreased my breakouts, I recommend you find that one and use it.
