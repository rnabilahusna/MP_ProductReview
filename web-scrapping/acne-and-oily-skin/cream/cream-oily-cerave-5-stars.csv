Great product, like all CeraVe products",5.0,"If you're familiar with CeraVe's habit of producing simple, effective, and high-quality products, then you will not be disappointed with this. Basically, it's just great. It does exactly what it is designed to do—nothing more and nothing less. I use tretinoin at night, so I use this product in the morning after cleansing my face and before using moisturizer (You shouldn't use retinols/retinoids/tretinoin and salicylic acid at the same time). You should wear sunscreen if you put this on in the morning, but every good skincare routine includes sunscreen anyway. This product does a great job at exfoliating the skin and making it turn over, so it may make your skin dry if you use it too often. Apply it as often as your skin is comfortable with it, and enjoy the incredible results!",16

I was about to give up",5.0,"I was desperate to find something to help my acne. It was hormonal. It was cystic. It was “normal” acne. It was “bacne”. All in one. And so consistent. I used to use ZapZyt which was the only product I could find that worked.And then it just, stopped working once I started taking Testosterone.Nothing worked. No hemp cleanser, no Neutrogena Salicylic Acid cleanser, no Salicylic Acid exfoliating bar. No African Black Soap. Nothing. I used this in conjunction with the SA acne clearing cleanser by CeraVe as well, however, I can tell you where I know it’s this gel.I’ve been using the cleanser for my bacne as well as my face. And Wow. Again. Nothing was helping with that even a smidge until this cleanser. Now I have actual hope and I could wear a tank top without feeling self-conscious.BUT, it’s still not perfect. My bacne isn’t gone.HOWEVER, my face? From using this gel???It’s helped wonders. My cystic acne is going away. I’ve only had tiny white heads in 2 places. My redness has gone down so much.I have combination skin. Some places are slicker than grease and others are drier and developing fine lines. And this stuff is not only moisturizing, but balancing.I hadn’t felt like there was any other option but Il Makiage’s foundation. Which I sought out because of how bad my acne was. It had been atrocious for a whole year and I was really at a place where I was ready to give up on having clear skin.But in one last and final desperate attempt, I splurged on this when my debt really was telling me not to. And I don’t regret it because of it’s results.So if you have the money, if you have these issues, I’m begging you to give it a shot. And I really hope it helps you like it helped me and all the people before that encouraged me to give it a shot too!! Best of luck to you",52

Works fast!",5.0,"Omg this product is a life saver! This works after the first time using. I don’t get breakouts, not sure what happened but I’ve been dealing with a terrible breakout entire face. Redness swelling, aching really bad. I have oily sensitive skin but no breakouts so not sure what happened. This stuff is amazing!!! Noticed my red puff raw breakouts dried and shrank after first use. My face is feeling a whole lot better after second use. Love it! Thin, gentle, feels nice and light on face. Redness diminishes. Thank you cerave! Update: I was skeptical about adding to my makeup routine but this is thin, fast drying-melts into skin so it did great! This is my first step before oils, moisturizer, primer, foundation, etc…UPDATE: 15 days later- my breakouts are completely gone! Skin soft and smooth no breakouts at all!!!! I was going on 3 months with not being able to get rid of breakouts, this worked!!!It’sa nice gel fresh feeling on face! Apply to every morning and every night after cleansing and before skin and make up routine. THANK YOU CERAVE!!!",23

Be Patient and Be Consistent!",5.0,The truth is that getting your skin to clear up the way you want is a timely process. I encourage anyone who doesn't know how blemishes form to educate yourself. The acne on your face is about 3 months old because it takes forever to form on the surface. Expecting to use a product and have next day results is not realistic. What I can say is that I have gotten into a very good skincare routine. This has been my first time introducing various aspects of this acne treatment into my routine and I wish I found it in my younger years. It is a game changer. My skin is very oily and the thought of putting anything hydrating  or oily on my already oily skin sounded terrible. I would constantly use acne treatments that would overly dry out my skin and contribute to more acne. Now I use a variety of products but I always have a good moisturizer to put over my face after using the product and letting it dry to ensure these types of great products work the way they are intended. Using only this on your skin will likely dry your skin out so research some great dermatology videos about acne and I'm sure you will figure out how to make a great routine. Be consistent. Be patient. Two very important things. I highly recommend adding this into your skincare routine.,20

MUST HAVE FOR POST BIRTH CONTROL HORMONAL ACNE",5.0,"I NEVER write reviews .. but this stuff is amazing!!! The first & third photo are from January 20th, & the second & fourth photo are from today, March 11th. I have never had acne previously, but when i got off birth control about 8 months ago, I began to struggle terribly with hormonal acne. Coming from someone who has never struggled with acne before, I had no idea what to do. I did some heavy research & came across staple products that I wanted to use.My routine is as follows:AM: Kiehl’s ultra facial cleanser, Cerave acne control gel, Cerave vitamin c serum, & Cerave daily moisturizing creamPM: Kiehl’s ultra facial cleanser, Cerave resurfacing retinol serum, & Cerave moisturizing creamThis routine has SAVED my skin & prevented new breakouts from occurring. Of course i still get a pimple or two around my cycle, but nothing like before. I had a hard time finding reviews that spoke of post BC acne, so I hope that this helps someone!It is advised to use a moisturizer with SPF when utilizing salicylic acid & vitamin C, so once my AM moisturizer is gone I plan to replace the cerave daily moisturizing lotion with the cerave daily moisturizing lotion with SPF.Hope this helps!",63

Trying this out as a replacement",5.0,"I started using CeraVe Acne Control Gel three to four months ago. Before that, I’d been alternating between two products with AHA and BHA ingredients since 2017 (Skinceuticals’ Blemish + Age Defense and Jan Marini’s Bioclear Lotion). So far, CeraVe’s product is working just as well for me, even though the active ingredient % is lower than what’s in the products I had used before. I’m happy with it, since I’m getting the same healthy skin results at a less expensive price point :)I’d recommend trying CeraVe Acne Control Gel for reasons like:1) It might be good to use if your skin is new to salacylic acid + glycolic acid products like this one. It has 2% salyclic acid. I didn’t experience any irritation, although my skin is used to this ingredient (was using 3.5% product for years).2) Along that same point, it could be a good product for you if a higher % ingredient irritates your skin.3) Cost/Value. Maybe paying more for skincare products isn’t possible, or you’d like to reduce how much spend on skincare products. For me, it makes a lot of sense to spend less for the same skin results. In case it’s helpful to know, it cost $12 for 1.35 oz of CeraVe gel (from Amazon) while the more expensive products that I swapped out cost $80-$92 for 1 liquid oz.Just a note: While this product works well for me, individual results can depend on what’s possible based on overall skincare routine, healthcare, and skin type.",35

No More Acne!",5.0,"I have had acne all my life - and I’m now almost 37 years old. I’ve tried soooooo many products and I’ve found stuff that slows down the breakouts but not that eliminates them.To be honest, I’d never tried CeraVe because I figured if it wasn’t expensive it probably didn’t work.

Worked for me",5.0,"I have very acne prone skin that breaks out with the slightest change in routine. I used to have acne every single day, but got it under control a few years ago with right combination of topical and oral meds. Recently had to start wearing a mask at work again everyday to reduce the risk of getting sick before going on a cruise, and my face broke out so badly. Hasn’t been this bad in years. I spent a long time sobbing in my bathroom. Took a chance and ordered this after reading the reviews, as I use their moisturizer without having any acne issues. Very glad I decided to try this gel. Four days after starting to use it and I have very few spots left on my face, and haven’t gotten any crazy new ones. It works as a spot treatment also. Dabbed some on a stubborn one last night and it was flat by morning. I apply moisturizer, my aczone lotion and this gel at the same time to prevent pilling. I just put a dab of each on my finger and rub it all in at once. So far so good. No dryness or peeling.",9

Great for helping prevent breakouts",5.0,"For background, I’ve struggled with acne ever since I was 12 years old. I’ve been through two rounds of accutane but still have scarring and some breakouts.I decided to try this product when I noticed my breakouts were getting bad again, mainly out of fear of getting back to my pre-accutane days (those who get it, get it). At first I didn’t see much of a difference, but after two months I realized I hadn’t had an active pimple in weeks. I even tried switching to a different Cerave product (the retinol serum) for a month and found I liked this much better.Notes:- Two times a day helped the most- Make sure you’re moisturizing after using (at night I try and “slug” with my lotion and I wake up with my skin looking great)- Give it at least a month before writing it off- USE SUNSCREEN",10

It reduces acne and redness over night and break outs don’t even get a chance to start. 10/10 CeraVe,0

Acne not meth sores",5.0,"70 years old with rosacea since age 10, see a dermatologist and use Rx metrogel. But nothing is the cure. Break throughs happen with large bumps, swelling and redness. This 2% salicylic acid with niacin and AHA can be used 1-3 times daily as a spot treatment. It decreases redness and keeps the eruptions from looking like we have meth face going on. You need a wide brimmed sun hat to protect your skin. If you have rosacea you already know that.",3

Amazing, Incredible, Show Stopping, Never Been Done Before",5.0,"Had a HORRIBLE breakout of cystic acne all over my chin and this brand was literally the only thing that could help me. It's like a cheaper alternative to ProActive, which is incredible. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has worked wonders without overdrying or breaking out my skin. I use it right after the SA Cleanser and right before the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, then their daily moisturizer on top. It's all god-tier. Highly highly recommend all their products to anyone who's at the end of their rope with a bad breakout or cystic acne. Thank you CeraVe!!!! ;___; <3",39

Works well, kinda sticky before it dries",5.0,"I like this a lot, its not too harsh so I can use it frequently but also does the job and I've seen a huge reduction of acne. It is kinda sticky though so I usually use it more at night but I do use it in the day if I have ample time to let it dry completely before adding anything else. My boyfriend says it smells like pancakes, and I can agree with that, it does smell mildly sweet so thats a nice bonus",2
