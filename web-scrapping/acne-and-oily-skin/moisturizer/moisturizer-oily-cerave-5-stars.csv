Great daily moisturizer with SPF",5.0,"CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 is a true skin-saver in my daily routine. With its exceptional 4.8-star rating, it's clear that many others have found this product to be a gem.The inclusion of SPF 30 in a daily facial moisturizer is a game-changer. It offers reliable sun protection while keeping your skin hydrated and healthy. As someone who prioritizes skincare, I appreciate the non-comedogenic, oil-free formula, which means it won't clog pores or cause breakouts.The lightweight texture is perfect for daily wear, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It serves as an excellent base for makeup, too.CeraVe is known for its dermatologist-recommended products, and this one is no exception. It contains essential ceramides that help maintain the skin's natural barrier, leaving it smooth and nourished.I've rated it just shy of 5 stars because, while it's an outstanding product, I sometimes wish it came in a larger size, as I go through it relatively quickly with daily use. Nevertheless, CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 is a must-have for those looking to simplify their skincare routine without compromising on sun protection and hydration. Highly recommended!",25

Light ""sunscreen"" scent, dries quickly, moisturizes face",5.0,"I really like this product.Pros:- Includes SPF protection to protect your face from the sun. I like that it includes it so you're not layering products on your face as much.- A little goes a long way. You don't need much and it is easy to spread and rub into your face.- The CeraVe brand has been around a while and I trust that it's bringing back healthy moisture to my skin. I've not had a dry face since I started using it.Cons:- It sometimes feels heavy and can leave face feeling ""slick"". It's not bad, I still use and will continue to buy the product, but I wish it dried as cleanly as other products do (such as their lotion for nighttime). But I suspect the sunscreen combo is the reason it feels heavier on the skin.- It does have a ""sunscreen"" fragrance. Which I like personally but if you're looking for something that doesn't have a smell at all, then it might not be for you. It is very light though.",23

Best Am Moisturizer!",5.0,"This product cleared my skin up. I love all CeraVe  products, they work wonders for my skin! Only thing I have a problem with this moisturizer is that it flakes if you add too much and if it's raining and you get rain on your face, when it comes off it will start to turn white on your skin, but, other than that I can work my way past this product since it clears up my skin.  One time I accidentally slept in this moisturizer before taking it off and I woke up the next day with clear skin. Amazing delivery too and fast arrival. :)",8

Searched and found that one exists, so instantly ordered one! It's pretty easy to spread, I don't see any white after spreading the moisturizer for a bit.

Absorbs quickly, no white residue and perfect under makeup",5.0,"I burn the second I walk into the sun and let’s be real we are all learning the sun is not are skin friends no matter what age you are. This is the perfect sunscreen because you can wear it everyday with or without makeup. Some days I just wear this sunscreen because I am running out of the house quickly but other days I have put foundation, powder and concealer on top of this and all the products still work perfectly. It blends in perfectly and also has never caused any break outs or blemishes. Absolutely love this product and the price makes it even better",4

Now part of my morning routine",5.0,"I use a product that has retinol as part of my nightly face regimen. I was told that using a sunscreen during the day is a must since retinol can cause more sun sensitivity. I had a few saved when I was talking to my mom about it. She recently had a precancerous lesion on her face treated and her dermatologist recommended CeraVe as a daily moisturizer. He specifically mentioned their AM cream because it has the added sunscreen. Apparently my grandmother also used this product for years after switching from Olay products. I decided to order it.I wash my face with soap and water every night but do not use soap in the morning. I rinse well instead and use a toner to clean. I then apply an eye cream (not CeraVe but I'm looking into theirs) and a light face serum. After both have dried, I apply this and let set before applying any makeup, which I admittedly don't wear much. I've only been using for a short time but my skin feels so much softer. The fact that it has the added protection of a sunscreen is such a huge bonus for me. The bottle isn't huge but you don't need a lot so it lasts. I have senstive skin and this hasn't caused any issues for me. I will be using this daily in the morning from now on.",49

Great Moisturizer!",5.0,"CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizer is my 3rd favorite product in CeraVe’s facial product line-their Facial Cleanser for oily skin & their PM Facial Moisturizer being my top 2 favs. CeraVe is my go brand for facial products. With having oily skin & at one time acne, I’ve tried many products, some good, some no good. I’ve done a lot of research into what my skin needed for optimal look & health. I’ve always gone back to CeraVe. What they offer in their AM Moisturizer is gold for our skin. The 3 essential ceramides, niacinamide (B3-which helps build skin cells while protecting them from environmental stresses) & hyaluronic acid-which retains water to help the tissues in our skin well lubricated & moist as well as a ton of other benefits!) are 3 key ingredients our skin needs. With this moisturizer being SPF 30 it’s a good amount of sun protection for our face. The lotion is scent free. The 3oz. bottle goes a long way for the price. This cream I don’t consider to be lightweight though vs. their PM moisturizer. It’s heavier. This is where it shows like it is more of a sunscreen cream vs. a moisturizer but it is doing its thing by protecting my skin. This does leave my face with an oily residue. This is the only downside for me with having oily skin & using this moisturizer. To help with that problem I apply my favorite primer once the moisturizer has set in. Then I apply my powder, either loose or compact. Once all of that is in place I see no oil & I know my face has protection from the sun as well as benefiting from all that the moisturizer has. Since Winter hit & I’m not outside, some days never the AM I use the PM moisturizer which is much lighter. Overall this is the perfect moisturizer to entail into your skincare regime. I have it on my subscribe & save list so I save a little extra & order when needed. One bottle lasts me 3 months or longer. I hope this helps to give you an idea as to why this moisturizer is so good. Wonderful quality at an affordable price. Highly recommend!",14
