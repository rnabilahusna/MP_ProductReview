Bad quality and unclear return policy",1.0,"I’m not satisfied with this product. It caused irritation, and when you apply your foundation after this moisturiser, it doesn’t fit smoothly. Also, during the day, it starts peeling. I want to express my dissatisfaction about the return policy. The seller didn’t clearly state that this product is not returnable, so when I tried to return it, I couldn’t. I’m really disappointed.",0

Very expensive. Bottle size is a joke",1.0,"Most lotions direct you to ""apply liberally"" around the face.If you did that with this lotion, which only comes in one micro travel size bottle,you would run out within a week.So it's expensive, but if it works well, at least let us order a size that allows us to use the lotion as directed and not need to reorder so frequently. Maybe a bottle large enough to be able to see if the claims are legit before reordering...The lotion is exorbitantly priced and sized as if it were only applied around your eyes.What a joke.",0

Beep! Beep! Beep! Back away now…!",1.0,"As someone who has sensitive oily skin this product was horrible. I also have dark skin which makes moisturizer a great or horrible adventure for me.  This product was not for me at all. The smell is overwhelming for this product. I even tried using a pea sized amount but the smell was too much. It also feels sticky and just sits on the face which makes it a nightmare when trying to use it as part of a routine with other products. Finally, my face just reacted with this product. I would not recommend this product at all.",2

It can't be returned",1.0,"I really love La-Roche Posay products, but unfortunately this type of moisturising didn't work for my skin. My skin is very sensitive, but since in the description says tested on sensitive skin I wanted to give it a try. Definitely gives you that mat look and skin feels soft it really takes the grease/shine away. It had a strong smell... My skin is so sensitive that after a few minutes, it starting burning and couldn't bear it on my face and had to wash it off :(. I use other products of the same brand like the foam wash, moisturizing with sunscreen and I really didn't have any problem with those. You need to aware that this moisturizer can't be returned, I am very disappointed.",0

Bad Experience",1.0,"The first and only use burned my skin. I used it after the cleaner they have, as the clean cleaner was drying my face. This burned and dryed my face until was being peal like a snake.Just one thing, it does helps you minimize your pores, as in one try I saw the difference, but it was doing worst more for me.For those interested, my face was oil and is NOT a sensitive skin.",0

Sensitive Skin? Avoid!",1.0,"If you have sensitive skin, you may want to avoid this product. I am particularly sensitive to salicylic acid - a prime ingredient in acne medication - it makes me break out. After using this product, I found that it does pill up and peel if you touch your face at all, even during makeup application. Then I noticed I was starting to break out... I checked the ingredients once more and lo and behold near the very end ""salicyclic acid"" I know I checked before I purchased it, but the combination of not thinking this product would use it and the ingredient being near the absolute end of the list made me miss it. Wish I could return it, oh well.",2

BEWARE",1.0,"First of all: the package seemed to have been opened before. There was no seal on the product, which means it may have been tampered with.My skin started burning about 10 minutes after applying this to my face. I tried rinsing it off after I realized the burning sensation wouldn't go away after 5-10 minutes, as what sometimes happens when I use a new product for the first time. I am currently sitting with a bag of ice on my face, wondering how I am going to sleep.Not sure what's in this stuff, but perhaps if you use prescription acne meds like I do (tretinoin, clindamycin + benz peroxide) this probably isn't for you. I've never had any problems with any other beauty care products until this one.",0
