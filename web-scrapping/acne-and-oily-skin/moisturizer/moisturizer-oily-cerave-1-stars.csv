Leaves residuals on skin",1.0,"I like CeraVe products, but was very disappointed to find that this product doesn’t work. Should have read some of the other reviews first. It’s hard to smooth the product into the skin, and little white balls started to form as I tried to gently smooth it on my face. I tried a few times with or without other serums under it and got the same results. I had to return it. This is the first time I returned a product bought on Amazon.",0

Does NOT blend",1.0,"I have tried to give this product many chances, but I hate it. It’s extremely streaky on my face & peels off into little flakes. It takes me 10 minutes alone just to rub it into the skin. By the time I finish I feel that there’s no product left on my face as it’s all peeled off. It is the worst sunscreen I have ever used. The only benefit is that it doesn’t break me out.",0

do not get this confused with CeraVe’s Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion with Sunscreen",1.0,"I usually use CereVe’s ultra light moisturizing lotion with sunscreen as it is lightweight, leaves no white cast, and contains spf 30 but i thought to buy this one as it shouldn’t be much different and has a bigger packaging. do not make the same mistake i did! this one clumps up on your skin and is so challenging to blend in. it is one of the worst face sunscreens i’ve used. do not recommend!",0

It is NOT FRAGRANCE FREE!",1.0,"This product is not fragrance free.  I'm extremely sensitive to fragrances, so cannot use this product. I tried a bit of the product on my lower neck, but had to wash it off. It's not just a slight smell, but very distinctive. I thought it would work for me, as the Cerave lotion and face wash that I use are fragrance free and causes no problem. I will be returning it.",0

Stay Away! Clumps and peels horribly - does not absorb into the skin.",1.0,"CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 is one of the worse (if not the worse) facial product/s I have ever purchased. I do not know if I just received a bad batch or if the product is just that bad. I purchased 2 bottles and get the same results and so will assume that this product is just poor. I've used other CeraVe products (ones without a sun blocker) and have liked them typically. Not at all the case here.I have sensitive skin and purchased this product because I wanted a moisturizer with a greater SPF rating than the one I was using which was only rated at SPF 15.When I first apply to my face this product leaves a whitish and pasty layer. As I try to blend into my skin, it starts to peel and quickly clump into little white globs. It looks worse than terrible. Regular sunscreen does a much better job. I end up having to wash off completely and starting over.I have tried using this product standalone after cleansing my face to see if I can salvage or use the product at all. Unfortunately, the outcome is always the same - clumping and then peeling. Silly me kept thinking that it was something I was doing and so kept trying to use the product and before I knew it I had missed the return window.I would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason and cannot understand the rating of 4.6 which cannot be legitimate based on my experience.",34

Too thick and rolls on skin",1.0,I love CeraVe skin care products. I use at least 5 different CeraVe skin care products with my morning and night routines.Unfortunately this moisturizer / sunscreen is way too thick and always rolls on my face If I do more than a single pass with it. Two passes or a touch up immediately results in it rolling and flaking heavily.,0

It does not absorb - leaves a white residue on skin.",1.0,"I expected so much better from this product, given all the great reviews.  I've used moisturizers with sunblock before and have never had this type of experience.  It absolutely refuses to absorb or even rub into my skin - it smears into white streaks and in places, almost rolls up into balls.  Maybe this product was already bad when I bought it, and this isn't normal.  I thought at first it was reacting to the Olay serum I was putting on first... but I had the same experience when applying the Cerave on without the serum first.  I actually have to use a wet washcloth to take this stuff off.  I rarely throw items away, but this one went in the trash after many attempts at using it.  I'm only writing the review now so I remember not to try it again.  Back to my Olay moisturizers!",7

Burns my eyes so bad!",1.0,"I used to regularly use this product until I switched over to Vanicream daily moisturizer with SPF (seems to be just like this product - only way better). I went back to this after noticing the Vanicream item has been out of stock for awhile. HORRIBLE… it has ruined a couple of my days this week from how bad it burns my eyes. I tried to keep it away from my eyes as much as possible but it didn’t help! I also have dry skin so I use more moisturizer but this one just pills, leaves a white cast, and doesn’t blend in well at all. Very disappointed in this and I’ll be going back to Vanicream (even if I have to go far out of my way) because it doesn’t burn my eyes and is much more effective!",6

Terrible pilling, won't stay on face, hard to spread",1.0,"This lotion is:- hard to spread- pilling like crazy. after applying, if you look closely in the mirror, you see hundreds of tiny white pieces. I don't have anything else prior to or after this lotion. Sometimes when you layer skin care products that happens. but this is not the case. If you remove the pills, you basically remove the lotion. if you don't, you look weird.Not sure why this product got such a high rating, but for me, 2 star is being generous. will never buy again",8

Sloughs Off Even on Good Skin",1.0,"I like some CeraVe products, and saw this one and thought it might be a good daily moisturizer. I purchased the AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion. I have a lot of different lotions, brands, and I noticed this had hyaluronic acid (great for lips and skin), which helps with moisture. I applied to a clean face, let it set and then tried to apply makeup, it started to slough off, awful. I rewashed my face thinking it was reacting to the foundation, and applied the lotion again. I then just left it (no makeup), and after about 20 minutes I rubbed my cheek and it started sloughing off again, disgusting. Rubbing all over my face sloughing like crazy. Okay, the expiration date is ok. I keep my skin exfoliated so.... Tried it on my forearms, top of hands, same sloughing. There is no other brand, no lotion that I have had this happen. Is it old? Fake? Trash? Yeah, going in the trash. What sucks is this is the second time I purchased this from this seller, and it happened before. But, I on that occasion I forgot about it and let it sit for a few months and thought it might have been my fault, so here I purchased it again....ugh.",12

Disappointed",1.0,"I’m aware that this company has a good reputation but I dislike this product so much that I’m wondering if I missed an important set of instructions and the problem is user error. This cream goes on very white & pasty and “drags” on the face. Only by using the tiniest amount can I even get it to disappear into my skin. Afterwards, I can literally roll my finger across my skin and get little white flakes. All I was looking for was a good face cream with a decent amount of sunscreen. Unfortunately for me, this product isn’t it.",2

Worst product",1.0,I purchased two for our home of 4. This made all of our (incredibly different types of) skin clogged leading to pores. I didn’t understand my my 13 & 8 year old suddenly had horrible acne. Then I started using it and I’ve had more pimples and clogged pores at 36 than ever before. There’s a high enough correlation to determine causality when no other variables were involved on the skin of different skin types not prone to acne.,4

However, it's blatantly deceptive to brand this ""facial moisturizing lotion with sunscreen"".  This is not a moisturizer.This has the thickness of sunscreen, the white cast of sunscreen, the smell of sunscreen, the sticky occlusive feel of sunscreen, and the difficulty to wash off without an oil-based cleanser like sunscreen.  It also makes my face feel heavy and itchy, like many brands of sunscreen do.This doesn't have the moisturizing function of a moisturizer.  My skin is greasy but parched within 30min after applying this.Really disappointed that a well-known brand like CeraVe decided to jump onto the ""moisturizer with SPF"" wagon without bothering to actually make a moisturizer.I've been trying to get through a small bottle of this for months.

So I decided to give this a try since it's about the same price and it's easier to store.I don't doubt this product works; however, the product is thick and very much like a sunscreen and doesn't absorb into the skin very well at all. I also use a water-based serum before I apply this product and I'm not sure if that's part of the problem or not but when I apply on my skin, I get a lot of flakiness and streaks.

Okay",1.0,"The sunscreen is okay. I love cerave I use their moisturizers and face washes but I don’t really like the sunscreen . I have dry sensitive acne prone skin and this sunscreen does not break me out or irritatate my skin at all which is great, the sunscreen smell is not too strong but u can definitely still smell is which I’m not too happy about. My main complaint is the pilling I make sure my face is completely clean from all products before I put this on and it still pills and separates especially after I reapply it.",0

It won't absorb (leaving white smears on my face).Unfortunately I bought two bottles and now I'm stuck.,2

I got Burned!",1.0,"Unfortunately, after a long time wearing ONLY Physical sunscreens, I decided to give this product, which I purchased last November (still good AFA shelf life) another chance. I put it on and drove to the post office and back, early in the morning. When I got home, I saw my face in the mirror and was horrified to see that I had either got burned by the sun or by this product (and the sun too probably). I’m about to wash it off now and throw it away. I have worn it before and I was never burned, although my eyes got itchy. Anyways, I’m now about to apply Purito centella green unscientific sunscreen SPF50 PA++++.(Korean sunscreen) It has Centella Asiatica in it which calms, as well as a load of antioxidants. It’s supposed to be one of THE best sunscreens, so we’ll see!Its a shame that the USA is so far behind on UVA filters. I imagine most people don’t realize that most sunscreens protect against UVB (burning) and barely any UVA (aging, cancer, etc). UVA is very scary, it’s what comes through car windows etc., so when you drive you’re not being protected against those deep penetrating rays.So unfortunately, this is going in the trash can. It’s a shame that we can’t trust these types of items, especially US Sunscreens, to shield us from the harmful rays.",2

Never again. It leaves a white cast that peels off no matter what I do. So im sure it’s not even absorbing into my skin therefor not protecting me from the sun light.

First time using Moisturizer that makes your sky even DRIER and worse.",1.0,"I started using their Itch Relief cream in the just prior to purchasing this product... It seemed to be working at first, but after using it for about a week or 2, my neck was only getting worse in regards to it being dry and becoming worse after use.  At the time while I thought the cream was working, and hearing that this company was better then most in store / over the counter brands... I wanted to try a new facial cleanser as well as a new moisturizer.  Just as the facial cleanser was a let down, you can add this product to the list of let downs.  I have never used a facial moisturizer that actual makes your skin drier then prior use.  Well, this product is definitely a first for that.  As I mentioned in another review, I heard good things about this company and their products.  Maybe that were true years ago... but that is not the case now.  3 different products I have bought and tried from this company... all 3 FAILS.",2

Creating dry patches",1.0,"I have been using Nivea essentials daycreme for a long time, applying once a day in the morning and always had a smooth and moisturised face. Sadly, that product is not sold in the US, so now that I live here, I tried this Cerave, because it's recommended by derms and considered a good brand. Now, my face keeps getting super dry patches, like really flaky. Initially, I added more lotion to the dry patches during the day, but it's only getting worse, so I'm going to stop using this product.Maybe the product works really well for people with acne-prone skin, because dry skin is good to avoid acne, but it's really not working for me. I never had much acne because I have a naturally dry skin. With the Nivea, it was always super moisturised though.",2

It is a very thick formula and takes some work to rub it into the skin. I didn’t mind this too much because is did seem to create a barrier to protect my skin from the sun. However, on the first day of using it my skin became very dry and started to peel. Keep in mind I do have very sensitive skin. It’s just annoying to get a product that does the opposite of what I bought it for. It’s a shame because I had heard good things about this product.
