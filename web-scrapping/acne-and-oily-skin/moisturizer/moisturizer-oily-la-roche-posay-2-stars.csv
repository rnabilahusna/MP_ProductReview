Still shiny, no matte",2.0,"I feel like a loner amid all of these raving reviews -- how did this work so well for everyone else?! I have combination oily/dry/sensitive skin + a lil' eczema for some razzle-dazzle. Though the moisturizer itself didn't irritate my eczema toooo much (just a tad) and felt nice to apply...it also didn't mattify my T-zone + chin shine. Within a couple of hours of applying, those spots were back to full-on shiny! Bummer -- especially given the cost.",0

Very interesting",2.0,"I pondered this moisturizer for some time due to the price & the size. I continued to come back to it. I decided to spend the most I ever had on a moisturizer which doesn’t really carry much of the great ingredients other moisturizers do but I have such oily skin & wanted something to control it. My skin is somewhat sensitive. Acne prone but mostly gone just oily with visible pores. Story? I couldn’t believe it honestly. This is so mattifying that it provided no moisture to my skin. Once applied it immediately was absorbed. Oil gone but within 15 minutes dry patches. Flaky. Drying somewhat for someone with oily skin is a wish but not like this. Around the drying I began to have red blotches appear. I was in disbelief. I set myself up for such great things with this experience & highly rated moisturizer & it didn’t turn out well for me. Really no moisture. It really does what it says. For me personally my skin reacted to it differently than others with oily skin. It’s unfortunate because heads up!! you can’t return this product. As with as facial products some things work & some don’t. Some are more costly than others. This was a costly didn’t work product for me. This is my story & I hope it helped in some way. My 3 star reflects the fact that it does do what it says, it is Mattifying.",7

Disappointed",2.0,"I purchased this after reading a review of the top oil control moisturizers for 2023. This one was rated the #Best, but it didn’t control my T-zone oil at all. I could feel that yucky greasy film on my nose an hour after using. I was prev using ELF matte, was in love with it! but the last cpl times it was hard to find and when I did find it, it didn’t work like it used to?!I use an oil free Clinique cleanser and it works great, just need to find that perfect matte moisturizer to pair it with.Sadly for me, the search goes on….",2

SMP (scalp micro pigmentation) headshine",2.0,"SMP (scalp micro pigmentation) headshineIf you have had SMP done (scalp micro pigmentation) and looking at this lotion to give you a matte look, my advise is to look elsewhere. This lotion knocks off the shine about 20-30% max. No real world difference. I did a full days test and waiting for 10-15 minutes to dry on my head each time after shower, middle of the day, nighttime etc. Same poor results each time.The best solution for SMP thus far is Peter Thomas Roth Mattifying Gel. It knocks the shine down 95%. Keep a bottle with you as you’ll have to re-apply every 6 hours but it’s the best solution I have found. The stuff just works.Others that did NOT kill the bald head shine- The Body Shop Tree Tea Mattifying Lotion- Headblade Lube Matte (get this for just the moisturizing properties)- Seriously Shine Free (Aloe Very + BambooI burned my cash buying and testing, no need to burn yours.",3

I thought well maybe this will go away over time, so I tried it for 7 nights, and nope every time my face feels like it's burning.  For $34 with tax for tiny tiny tube of cream that makes my face burn, it just isn't worth it for me.",0

Skip!",2.0,"This is not on par with high end moisturizers or even other la roche posay lotions. I’ve been using for over a month now. Doesn’t moisturize at all. Skin is still just as dry on my cheeks as if I didn’t put anything on at all. Doesn’t actually mattify. No long term benefit for oil production. A waste of a product really. There are so many better options for oily skin, dry skin, any skin period. Also this brand is not cruelty free.",0

I have oily/combination skin so I thought a matte lotion would be a great idea.First time until the last time i've used it, the lotion doesn't seep into my skin. It sits on the surface and whenever I slightly rub my face, the lotion rolls off like exfoliated skin. I don't put on makeup, but I can only imagine how difficult it is to get make up to stay on.",5

Made me super oily",2.0,"Ok, so I got a sample size tube of this a few days ago. I was really eager to try this since my skin has been craving some moisture yet I’m so combination that any little bit of lotion that goes on my skin turns me into a grease ball within an hour and winds up breaking me out. I will admit that I love the fragrance of this. It is light and unisex. It is a fresh scent and appealed to me instantly. However, I don’t know if the tube I received is a fake or not because this moisturizer makes me super greasy so fast and has caused white heads to pop up since using it. I’m so bummed. I really need to moisturize as I am now in my late thirties and want to keep my skin looking somewhat decent as I age but I truly can’t fund something that doesn’t oil me up and break me out.

Made my skin more oily!",2.0,"I have really oily skin, and the 3 step Effaclar system has done a great job at making my skin less oily and clearing out my skin. I was really excited to try this product, because I've heard great things about it from makeup artists, reviews, YouTube videos, etc.That being said, I like the texture of the moisturizer, the feel of it and it's great as a primer. However, it made my skin a lot more oily! My makeup started smudging pretty fast. At the beginning I thought I just needed a little adjustment period so that my skin could adjust to using a moisturizer again, after I haven't for several months (yes my skin is that oily!), but it didn't seem to work. It took a week for the three step system to reset my oily skin to being normal again.I do have to say, that I think this just might be me personally and few others who have extremely oily skin. I live in a humid climate, so that contributes as well. Comparing the level of oiliness before I used the moisturizer and after I started using it, it definitely made my skin more oily unfortunately.",0
