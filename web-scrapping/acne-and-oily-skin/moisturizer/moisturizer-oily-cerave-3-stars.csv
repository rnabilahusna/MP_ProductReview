Peels if not applied in thin layers. Time Consuming.",3.0,"This was the first time I tried a moisturizer sunscreen combination and I was disappointed for several reasons.1. A thin layer must be applied, otherwise it peels off. Multiple layers must be applied for full protection.2. It leaves a white cast unless it is patted into the skin. Which takes about 5 minutes per layer.3. Leaves the skin a bit oily.The product does well in the following areas:1. It Moisturizes2. It is affordable3. Offers protection from the sun if you are willing to undertake the application process.All in all, I would say it’s okay but I would not buy again because it is too time consuming.",6

It's not you, CeraVe AM, it's me",3.0,"As much as I use an enjoy other CeraVe products, including the hydrating face wash, night cream, and eye repair cream., I really don't have good results with this.  No matter how little I use or how carefully I apply, It never seems to absorb completely into my skin and leaves a white cast all over my face. (I have a medium olive complexion.) What's worse is that the slightest amount of perspiration causes it to immediately start dripping down my forehead into my eyes, and especially makes my nose feel all wet and greasy - so forget about using it when it's even slightly warm outside or if I have to do any kind of physical activity.Given that many others seem to swear by this, I have to think it is some kind of reaction with my particular skin. In the meantime, I'll keep searching for a another daytime facial moisturizer with SPF instead of this one.",24

Too sticky for me",3.0,I like the Cerave products in general but this is not my favorite. More of a sunscreen with a touch of moisturizer than the other way around. Smells and feels like all sunscreen. I’d rather have good moisture without the stickiness and add sunscreen (a light feeling one). Everyone’s skin is different but I like a clean feel and this isn't it for me.,0

Thick, hard to blend",3.0,"I tried this after using ROC AM moisturizer for years, but most of my other skin care is cerave so I thought I’d love this. It’s so thick, it’s hard to glide across the skin. It definitely leaves a white cast. This is great for beach days but not every day under makeup , unfortunately.",0

Hard to rub in",3.0,I purchased this product because most of the reviews state that it is easily absorbed. I was looking for a moisturizer for my skin and liked that it had a SPF but it is hard to get the product to absorb in without rubbing it a long time,0

It's meh.",3.0,"I'm disappointed in this product, as my experience with Cerave's other products have been lovely.1 pump of this moisturizer is barely enough to cover your face, but if you use 2 pumps, it's too much and begins to pill, badly. It leaves a white sheen and takes a while to absorb. The smell is faint--my husband doesn't notice it, it just smells like sunscreen to me. I've also had a couple instances of breakouts, though I can't be sure if it's related to switching to a new moisturizer or an issue with the product itself. My face is mostly fine now, but I had to switch back to what remains of my old moisturizer for a couple days to even things out.Once you get outside (Florida heat) and sweat, it feels like the moisturizer is just melting right off, regardless of how long it's been since you applied it. If it's still early morning and you go right back indoors, you'll be fine.Comparing it to the old Aveeno simply radiant, Aveeno wins. I can't say for the new Aveeno recipe, however.For the size and price point, it's okay, and if you only use one pump, you probably won't have any pilling issues--but it might not be enough coverage. The only thing I really like about this product is that it's SPF30 and has no other fragrances. The only reason I switched moisturizers is because Aveeno changed their ingredient list. Once I've used this up, I'll be trying something else.",8

Not good for sensitive eyes!",3.0,"I switched to this moisturizer from a plain old-fashioned general moisturizer (without SPF), from the same company, which I used to use all over my face, including around my eyes, multiple times a day.This moisturizer began to burn my eyes within an hour of first use. After two hours, my eyes were watering. The next day I tried avoiding the eye area and this time it took all day to start stinging and burning. I'm assuming  I rubbed my eyes at some stage.It's pretty evident that it is the SPF sun block additive that is the problem. So, if you have sensitive eyes, avoid moisturizer with SPF!",0

Sounds good, but pills terribly",3.0,"I have to agree with the other reviews that say it’s not very moisturizing, you definitely need to have it on top of something like that already which I feel like should be unnecessary if it’s supposed to be a moisturizing lotion that ‘keeps your skin moisturized through the day.’ Combining it with a moisturizer does not work well, as it already pills up so badly by itself with and without makeup. I’m sure the sunscreen aspect is just fine otherwise, but it’s hard to see past the other downsides. I think I’ll have to try another kind next time.",0

The lotion goes on smoothly. The added SPF protection is a nice bonus, and it's great to have a moisturizer and sunscreen in one product. However, there is one issue that I've encountered while using it - when I sweat, the product tends to get into my eyes and causes a very strong burning sensation. This has been quite uncomfortable and has made it difficult to wear the sunscreen during workouts or other activities where I'm likely to sweat. Despite this issue, I still think it is a good product and would recommend it to others who are looking for a reliable facial sunscreen.

OK, But Leaves A white Residue",3.0,"A dermatologist suggested I start using a good facial moisturizer with sunscreen to prevent the formation of more dark spots on my face and address my dry, flaky skin. After much research, I figured I'd try therapy CeraVe AM and CeraVe PM. I like the PM better because it tends to apply seamlessly and is lightweight and goes on clear. The CeraVe AM provides moisture,  but it leaves my face with a somewhat tight feeling and a light white residue. As an African-American woman, the last thing I want is a white cast on my face making my skin look ashy. I had to go back and apply a little of the PM on top of the AM. or add the Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum on top of the CeraVe AM to make my face feel less tight and get rid of the white residue left from the CeraVe AM.. this combination seems to be working well. I'm not sure if I would purchase the CeraVe AM again. I think next time I'll try something better suited for African-American skin so I don't have to combat the white residue.",7

Okay product",3.0,Overall I think the product does a good job at moisturizing but isn't the greatest one I've seen. I love the Cerave brand but this product does have a smell that I don't care for and in the summer makes my face a lot greasier and shiny that other products. I think that for people with more oily skin should stay away from this unless they want shiny skin all the time.,0

*UPDATED* Decent moisturizer, wish bottle was sealed",3.0,"Began using retinol, so I needed moisturizing and sun protection in the AM. Normally use Cetaphil lotion but wanted something more substantial. I thought this was overpriced, but the quality is definitely higher. The lotion is richer, absorbs nicely, slight tackiness (but dries nicely), skin feels soft/moist after applying. Package was intact when received, however a hermetic seal would have been nice to have! There was much empty space in the bottle, no way of telling if it was shorted without emptying and measuring.*Updated* I had to return to correct the rating. After using for a few weeks, I began noticing the 'white cast' or 'flaking' that occurs when you apply and then rub in. It is really annoying when the residue hangs off your face. I didn't notice as much at first, but I wear glasses and didn't realize how bad it was. You have less flaking if you are able to apply to all parts of face before it begins drying. Once that starts, if you have a buildup of lotion, it will begin rubbing into flakes. Disappointed.",7

Kinda of disappointed with the texture and thick feeling of product.",3.0,"I really like Cerave light weight Lotion for my face. So I decided to give this SPF 30 cerave sunscreen a try. I am not a fan of sunscreens but with today's sun, the UVA UVB rays is damaging to skin. So decided to start using sunscreen.  I felt like this Sunscreen was thick and felt like the sunscreens one would use for beach days etc.  After applying it looks oily but absorbs quickly on face if you apply small amounts at a time.  If you try to apply a large quantity at once, it will take awhile to disappear from skin.  It didn't feel moisturizing either. This product felt like my pores couldn't breathe. After washing it off, my skin felt dried out and I have combination skin. It didn't feel like a moisturizer but again more of a sunscreen.  I have skin that's prone to occasional acne and need a product that is light and breathable for my skin. I am on the verge of returning this sunscreen but still deciding if to keep it and wear on days where I am going to be in direct sun for more than 2 hours like the Parks, beaches etc.  I don't think I will be purchasing this Cerave AM face lotion with spf 30 again.",4
