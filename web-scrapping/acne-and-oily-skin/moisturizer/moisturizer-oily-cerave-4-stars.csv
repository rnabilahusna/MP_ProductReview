Works great",4.0,This is a good moisturizer with spf for someone who needs fragrance free. If you have super dry skin then it‚Äôs not going to cover those dry spots with one application. I have to exfoliate my face first or use an additional moisturizer in the difficult dry spots. It works great otherwise. Does smell a little like suntan lotion but very light.,5

Reliable",4.0,"CeraVe is a skincare brand that offers a range of products such as cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens, and serums. The brand is known for its use of ceramides, which are natural lipids found in the skin that help to maintain the skin's barrier function.Overall, CeraVe products are highly rated by dermatologists and consumers alike due to their effectiveness and affordability. Many of their products are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and suitable for sensitive skin. The brand is also well-known for its moisturizing properties, which can help to improve the appearance of dry or irritated skin.However, as with any skincare brand, some people may experience negative reactions or find that the products don't work well for their specific skin type. It's always recommended to patch test new products and consult with a dermatologist if you have any concerns about your skin.My only concern is pricing I remember buying this product way cheaper in Sam's club",10

Has consistency of zinc oxide sunscreen",4.0,Probably a good choice to combine sunscreen with moisturizer for face when outdoors during summer. But this stuff is very thick and goes on like a heavy zinc oxide sunscreen. It does eventually become transparent but you have to work it in well. Also kind of expensive for the amount you get. Might be better to just use your regular moisturizer and then put your own sunscreen on over it. Definitely cheaper that way.,4

Great, but not as hydrating as I thought",4.0,"So this moisturizer seems like it will be great for protecting from the sun, but it isn't as hydrating as I had thought it would be especially after cleansing & toning my face. I had to add another moisturizer on top of it to have my face feel like it wasn't super dry. I do have the skin type that dries out easily after washing so that may be part of the issue. And I don't mind adding a bit of a different type of moisturizer on top. I have also used it mid day as a re apply and didn't feel like I needed additional hydration so it is likely just my skin type after washing.It doesn't leave a white cast on my face and it rubs in and absorbs really well in my opinion. I have very light skin so I cannot speak for darker skin tones.All in all I really like this lotion even though it isn't as hydrating after washing.The price is pretty good in comparison to other moisturizers with spf so I will likely continue purchasing this product.",19

I absolutely hate wearing foundation in the summer, so I mix a small drop of my foundation to the lotion and then apply it onto my face & neck.

good way to protect your skin daily",4.0,"I truly love cerave products and adore the nighttime version of this moisturizer that I‚Äôve been using for years. I am a person who absolutely hates everything about sunscreen, the texture, smell, rubbing it in, the aftermath feeling of it in my skin, everything. Although this doesn‚Äôt solve these problems for me, it drastically helps. Since the spf is in a moisturizer it spreads more easily and doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm rubbing chalk into my skin. When it dries I still get the stiff sensation that sunscreen leaves but I‚Äôm happy that my face is protected and it isn‚Äôt as horrible of a process as it could be. Because of the spf there is a slight slight tiny scent but it is truly unscented unless you are incredibly sensitive. The price is fair for a product of this good quality but I feel like it is a bit much. Perfect for someone who may forget to use sunscreen daily and wants to protect their skin.",12

Great way to put sunblock on your face!",4.0,"Putting sunblock on your face almost always feels awful, but this moisturizer makes it not so awful.I have the PM version of this moisturizer, too, and it‚Äôs amazing. This AM version adds some sunscreen to kick it up to SPF 30, and it does do without making the whole thing feel heavy and/or thick and/or greasy. It‚Äôs still noticeably thicker and heavier than the non-sunscreen version, but only by a little bit.As a huge bonus, it actually works. It does both of its jobs. It prevents sunburn and it keeps my skin moisturized. And by keeping my skin moisturized, it‚Äôs actually made my face LESS oily, presumably because it‚Äôs better balanced and doesn‚Äôt feel the need to always produce oil. Pretty great.I‚Äôd give it 5 stars if it felt identical to the PM moisturizer, but I‚Äôm also kinda thinking that may not actually be possible. Maybe it is, but this one doesn‚Äôt achieve that.",3

Works well; good product.",4.0,"The nozzles differ from bottle to bottle. Usually they dispense too little for each squirt. Also, the bottle is narrow and keeps falling over. One time the nozzle broke when the bottle fell off the Countertop.",4

Exceptional Moisturizer in Every Way",4.0,"This is without a doubt the best facial moisturizer I've ever used. It's very high quality. A small dab goes a long way and serves to keep skin in wonderful condition. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It was recommended by my dermatologist, and I'm thrilled to have it.4 STARS:  My only negative comment is that the container design is not well made for stability. It just will not stand up. It falls over constantly, and I'm hunting around for it, as a result. I wish there were a larger base to the bottle to anchor it, so that it would sit in an upright position. Please pass this on to your product design experts to see if they might consider a broader base to stabilize the bottle.",25

not for darker skin tones",4.0,"its very light and doesn't feel too heavy on my face, and it doesn‚Äôt really have that sunscreen smell !! only problem is that it makes me look a little paler, since i have a darker skin tone. i suggest that you buy the tinted one instead and it does a great job !!",6

Great",4.0,"I was expecting this to have more of a lotion-like consistency since it was advertised as a moisturizer, but it's basically a sunscreen. But overall, I'm very satisfied with the product. As someone with oily skin, I often struggle with finding the right sunscreen, and the cerave AM lotion keeps my face moisturized and provides sun protection, but doesn't make my face too oily. The scent of sunscreen is a bit strong though.",4

A solid choice for everyday use with SPF protection",4.0,"I've been using CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 for a while now and overall, I am satisfied with the product. The lotion has a lightweight, non-greasy formula that absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated throughout the day. The added SPF 30 is a great feature for daily use, providing a layer of protection against the sun's harmful rays. However, the smell is not my favorite, it has a medicinal scent that might be off-putting for some people. Additionally, the lotion is not as moisturizing as I would have liked, I still need to use a separate night cream. But all in all, it's a solid choice for everyday use with added sun protection.",13

does the job",4.0,"this is the only SPF moisturizer i‚Äôve bought for years because of the price & the ingredients. my only complaint is the white cast, which does fade after it absorbs & it also pills a bit but i‚Äôve found that it doesn't pill as badly if i press it into my skin rather than rub it in. other than that, it moisturizes great, doesn't clog my pores, its not greasy, it wears well under make-up and it i like the smell of it. has worked well for me for years & i would never use anything else!",17

Works well if not used on top of another product...",4.0,"During the quarantine I have tried to focus a little more on improving my skincare routine which is why I began incorporating sunscreen to my daily routine. I was drawn to this product because its a 2-in-one moisturizer and sunscreen which allowed me to minimize the amount of products I would need to layer on my face.The pros of this product are that it is a reasonable price, is moisturizing on my dry skin, has a reasonable SPF level (SPF 30) and leaves practically no white cast. It also works very well under makeup.The con however, is that this product is a bit tricky to layer. I apply a vitamin C serum to my face before applying this product. When it comes time to apply this product if I don‚Äôt act quickly it begins to clump up as I rub it on my face. I do not notice this clumping effect when I use it by itself or if I quickly apply it and don‚Äôt give the product any time to dry on my face (clumping starts after about 30 secs of applying it if I go back and add more). This is something to take into consideration if you layer several oils or serums before applying your moisturizer.I would also like to add that I have not noticed any breakouts or skin reactions when using this product. My skin is a bit on the dry side but it is generally not sensitive to products.Overall this product gets a 4/5 because the pros outweigh the cons but that clumping effect is a bit annoying.",2

Great product but use cautiously",4.0,Great product especially if you have acne prone skin. Doesn‚Äôt clog pores. It is very moisturizing and it has spf! That‚Äôs a plus! My skin is light brown so the only thing I hate is that it has a bit of the white tint sunscreen normally leaves on brown skin. It‚Äôs not as bad as normal sunscreen but I feel like I can tell. It smells pretty good (not highly scented but not medicinal). You only need about two pumps for your whole face.,22

Great Product but can Leave a White Cast",4.0,I have combination/oily skin and find that this product works best to moisturize my face without leaving it oily or shiny. CeraVe has been my go-to facial cleanser for years and I continue to be satisfied with the company after using this product. My face was well protected from the sun all summer and continues to provide benefits throughout the fall and winter. The only complaint I have is that the moisturizer can leave a bit of a white cast on my face that can take a bit of work to fully rub in.,6

It makes my face so soft and lasts a long time",4.0,"I really like the way my face feels after putting it on! After applying It hydrates me all day & night (when I don't wear make-up). It also does well under make-up but be sure it dries completely for a few minutes before the make-up or you'll smear.  I, also, use the body cream which is amazing . . .I don't get that dry skin feeling at all as you go thru the day/night.  Only problem I had was I put it too close to my eyes and they got irritated the whole time but now I just keep it about an inch from eyes and love it.  You'll really love this product along with their other creams.  Will always use now!",12

Good for sensitive skin",4.0,Purchased as an SPF and to help with moisturizer that is not greasy on skin.

Day moisturizer",4.0,I wouldn‚Äôt say that this is a #1 moisturizer. It definitely does moisturize but not as well as other products.
