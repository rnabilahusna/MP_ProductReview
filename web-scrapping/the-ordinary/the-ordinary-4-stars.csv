99% outstanding!",4.0,"I’m a 12 year old girl who >used< to suffer from closed cromedomes & redness on my lower cheeks and chin- these flaws deeply lowered my self esteem and I did a lot of research on this product before ordering, and I’m super pleased I did! The product came packaged well, and reading the reviews from ppl saying it was smaller than expected, I didn’t mind the amount of the serum. I’ve had it for around 8-15 weeks now and it’s made a HUGE impact on my skin!*At first I was worried it would be harsh and irritating, but it was incredibly gentle- even as I used it twice a day! I still would recommend a patch test.* My cromedomes vanished within a week yet then returned later on.. after I started using the Cera V spf moisturizer, not knowing that was the issue (the sunscreen) I stopped use of this product… the bumps got worse- yet vanished AGAIN after I quit the spf and continued this use.*It didn’t only tone my skin smoothly-> and get rid of my bumpy and red texture-> yet also brightened my face, and helped the dark circles under my eyes & blackheads on my nose!*1 flaw would definitely just be a warning about leaving the bottle open, because I got lazy once while camping and didn’t shut it all the way, leaving a strange white residue on the top opening of the bottle- it still works just as well though!* Less is more with this serum, and I did feel a slight irritation occur when using it with a vitamin C/D serum on my face at the same time.*I now use this as a base coat for my byoma moisturizer-> and my skin has never been better. Sense it is summer I’ve been using sunscreen again, and I can feel this serum fighting away the bumps that annoying spf is trying to cause on my face!The leaking part is the only flaw of this… and I will be buying again.Just remember that irritation, bumps, whiteheads, blackheads, fine lines, darkness under the eyes, wrinkles, and any of your ‘flaws’ on your face are what make you healthy, unique, and human.<3"

Time will tell",4.0,"I've been using this for only a few weeks. I don't notice drastic changes in my skin but then I don't think any product is a miracle product that will give me baby skin. Niacinamide is one of the best skin care ingredients you can apply. What it does do for me is help control sebum. My face doesn't get as oily, and I think over time, my pores will appear smaller. It can't shrink an existing pore, but if you're keeping the build up of sebum to a minimum, it can certainly keep them from getting larger, and less debris deep in the pores make them less noticable just by keeping the darker appearance down. It is a fast drying and tacky serum, I use a full pump all over and then apply my moisturizer over the top once it's dried down. Apply to the back of your hand and apply to one part of the face at a time. It can be hard to apply otherwise due to the tacky nature. As a side effect of sebum control, it has helped with the few spots I get. Though most of my breakouts are hormonal and I don't expect any one product to eradicate those, this has noticably helped lessen the amount of spots and the healing time is less. You can't go wrong for the price and the fact that there aren't any fillers, irritants, fragrances, or otherwise."

This product is REAL and the hype is justified!",4.0,"After reading lots of reviews stating that this is a fake product, I watched about 10 YouTube videos on how to spot fake The Ordinary products, and according to those, this product is REAL. I believe other people may have received a fake product, and maybe I just got lucky, but so far I am pleased.I’ve only been using for 3 days, so I don’t have an update on if it changes my skin, but I’m hopeful! The texture is different, but if you don’t use too much, it soaks in nicely and won’t leave a tacky layer on your face.  So far so good!EDIT 12/23/20– I love this stuff. I suffer from dry, textured skin, and also have acne and scarring. For the first time in YEARS my skin is smooth to the touch and I have NO NEW PIMPLES. I start with a micellar water, Cerave SA cleanser, Niacinamide serum, and finish with Cerave moisturizing cream. Simple, affordable, and IT WORKS.I did end up purchasing a second bottle from Sephora because it’s much cheaper, but packaging and product seems to be exactly the same."

Only $6 on their website",4.0,"I can't believe I paid $15 for this here when it's only $6 on their webpage! All The Ordinary products on Amazon are overpriced. Go to their webpage. It's great, though. It can also irritate. I discontinued it for weeks until nose recovered. Now I go easy on it until skin gets used to it."

Awesome Product",4.0,I really feel like this product helped to even out the oiliness in my skin. My only complaint is that it takes a while to soak in and I have to wait several minutes before applying my moisturizer.

Wanted to love it..",4.0,I read all the raving reviews and I was really excited about trying this product. It’s been about 2 weeks of consistently using it in the day and the night and honestly... I think the stickiness after the product dries is a deal breaker for me. I tried wearing it under makeup and it flaked up underneath. It was not a look. I prefer “the buffet” over this one.

Decent zinc serum!",4.0,"I really like how smooth and moisturizing this product serum feels on application. It is a high-strength vitamin-and-mineral blemish formula, with 10% pure niacinamide (vitamin B3) and 1% zinc PCA.Niacinamide reduces skin blemishes/clogged pores/fine lines, and visibly brightens skin tone. Zinc PCA visibly regulates excess sebum activity, and has all day oil control. I haven’t had any sensitivity to it. Love it!"
