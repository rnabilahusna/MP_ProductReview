The perfect cheer",5.0,"I have been using TO's 10% niacinamide on and off for the last 4 years. I stopped several months ago, and I noticed my facial and back skin breaking out more, feeling very thin and fragile, breaking easily from scratches, and getting burst blood vessels. Once I started re-using this serum, all of that stopped. I noticed the difference overnight. I feel the niacinamide strengthens my skin. I was ready to change everything in my routine but this is what I was missing.I have to work fast to spread this because it aborbs into skin very quickly. I do 3-4 small applications to cover my face. I have been diluting it by directly spreading it over the water that is still on my face after cleansing. That makes it easier to spread as opposed to when applying to completely dry skin. I estimate this brings down the niacinamide concentration closer to 5% which is sufficient and reduces irritation from high niacinamide percentage. I apply it after every cleanse, twice per day. I also use it under tretinoin, azelaic acid, lactic acid,  moisturizer, sunscreen. It works well with every thing. At my rate of usage, less than 1/4 tsp per application, this will last me about three months."

Better Than I Hoped For",5.0,"I purchased this B3 gel in desperation. I am 70 years old, have rosacea, facial eczema, and rosacea-related acne, redness and sensitivity, and very congested pores. Also, the age-related sagging and wrinkling that most women have. My complexion was very nice when I was younger, so all these problems have been challenging to say the least. Most creams, etc. make me break out or redden. A rosacea website suggested B3. In the past, I used a B3 cream which made me break out badly from the added coconut oil to which I am very sensitive. However, this brand has fewer ingredients,  no penetrants to inflame my eczema, and comes well-reviewed. It was also not terribly expensive. Most web reviewers note one must use B3 10% faithfully for three months to get full benefits. On the third day of use, however, I noted the redness of my facial skin subsiding, including my acne scars. By the end of seven days, my pores appeared smaller, even on my nose, and the overactive sebum glands in my T-Zone were shrinking. White heads were either coming to the surface and easily extracted after a shower, or shrinking below the skin. I started using this on my neck and noted increasing firmness (which I badly need). I am not much concerned with wrinkles, as I had oily skin until menopause, and have not yet noticed any difference. Because this gel is thick, I first spray with a non-alcohol toner, and then put one or two drops on my fingers and spray three times with the toner before applying. This amount covers my whole face, neck and eye area. I then apply a lightweight moisturizer  after the B-3gel has sunk in. At first, I only did this one time a day There is a very tiny bit of flaking from this gel--it is drying a little. That, I think, is why the acne scars improve. However, this flaking is not noticeable after I apply the moisturizer. I can use mineral powder makeup with no difficulty. I now use the B3 two times a day. The Zinc in this gel appears to prevent my acne from forming like any antibiotic. I will have an undersign cyst begin to form, but by the next day it is gone. I plan to keep using this product and have ordered oral B3 vitamins, also, but have not yet begun taking them. I feel I must be deficient in this vitamin to have such a positive response topically. I should add that I usually have to take extra oral zinc when I break out badly, because I had a bad, life-threatening staph infection six years ago. The breakouts I have from rosacea often become infected now and scar badly. This Topical treatment, however, means I no longer have to take zinc orally, which is much better for my system. I hope this very detailed review helps someone else who suffers from demagogical problems as I do. PS: I also may begin using this gel on the tops of my hands at night, under my hand cream, just to see if my aging skin improves there, too. Retin A appears to thin my skin, but this B3 seems to thicken the protective layer even when the gel is not applied. Try it!! UPDATE:  April 19, 2019. I am on my third or fourth bottle, buying them now for friends. I regret this review is so long, but so afraid the company will go out of business since their founder died. These are wonderful formulations--especially this one. I've not found anything as effective at any price. Started using the caffeine eye gel last night and saw a difference immediately."

Cleared My Acne And Improved Eczema",5.0,"This stuff's amazing! I have struggled all my adult life with acne, nothing horrible, just about 4-6 cystic acne here or there along with 3-4 regular pimples. I developed eczema during my pregnancy with my 2nd baby, and it just never went away afterwards no matter what I did. After using the niacinamide for 1.5 months nearly all my acne went away and I noticed a drastic change in the amount of redness and flakyness of my eczema. I only had an odd pimple or two after this stuff, all my cystic pimples ceased to ever happen again! The first two weeks I used it only once a day, 2x a week and increased by one more day a week after that, my skin ""purged"" during the first two weeks and I had a few small pimples, but those went away after my skin adjusted. I highly recommend to use this if you have acne, just make sure you only use 3-4 drops when applying, you do not need anymore than that! And I only use it once a day at night, and it has been amazing.If you have eczema on your face like I did, I also started using the ordinary's Marine Hyaluronics two months after the niacinimide, applying it 2x a week, 1x a day for the first two weeks, then gradually increased the days to where I apply it 2x a day in the morning and night, and as the first layer in my skin routine. Using it almost completely made my eczema go away, it really helped keep the skin hydrated so that there was hardly any redness and very little itching. Then after that I started using CeraVe's Moisturizing cream just on my eczema as my finishing layer 1x a day in the morning, and it went completely away!"

My Favourite Product",5.0,"The first two or three days I used it all over my face I had a very MILD breakout and corner of my nose was a bit sensitive.  For this reason I started to use Niacinamide only the areas with enlarged pores, being my nose and top area of cheeks.  I did try using on my entire face and neck after a few days again and had no problem, I believe my skin just needed to get use to this product.  After applying Niacinamide over face and neck I apply Cerave Moisturizing Cream.  I use every night sometimes during the day,After a few days of using this product my skin looked the same but felt very soft and smooth.  After about a week skin still felt soft and smooth and began looking brighter…just healthier looking.  After just over 2 weeks my enlarged pored stared to look a little tighter.  After a month I decided I loved this product.  My pores never looked better and I don’t have that dry stinging feeling you get with Retionol.  A little goes a long way with this product.The product itself is water bases so it absorbs well and further blurs any blemishes including pores when on the skin. A little goes a long way, you only need a few drops. The reason I purchased this product was to use for my enlarged pores but I am very happy for the additional benefits."

Best product for dark skin African Americans w/PCOS, psoriasis, hyper pigmentation and acne.",5.0,"I love this product!!! I have PCOS, acne, psoriasis, hyper pigmentation, and a ton of dark marks. I’m a dark complexion African American woman, and I’ve visited dermatologists who have given me many products to clear up my face. It was even suggested for me to use bleaching cream, but I do not want to get lighter, so I have refused to use it. I love my dark chocolate skin, but I do want the skin on my face to be even. This product is a miracle!!! My pores are almost non existent. If I have an outbreak of acne, it takes it away almost overnight. The scaling caused by the psoriasis on my face is gone. My face feels SO smooth!!! Also, my face is brighter!!! My tone is almost evened out!!! I used to wear make up to cover up my flaws, and now, I don’t need it. I just put on lashes, liner, and lipstick, then dip ✌🏿. LOL - I’m almost out and I need to order again. I’m SO happy I researched this product well, and then decided to buy it!!! I suggest fir anyone to try it!!!"

Acne Disappears in two weeks",5.0,"This is my first ordinary product. I am blown away about how good it worked for the first two weeks!  I’m  in my mid-40s and I have oily skin.  I had a stroke 4 years ago, and I take medication that causes acne.  I’ve tried many cleaners, serums, lotions, creams, vitamins, meds, and lasers with no luck.  This Ordinary product (Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%) came in small box and little packaging.  The two days, I used way too much product. My face was very slimy and sticky.  I did not like the way my face felt in my humid climate, so I place a product inside the closet.  The next day was reading an article that linked me to the bio the Ordinary’s founder, Brandon Truaxe, which was located on the Deciem (parent company) corporate website.  Ordinary’s website was so interesting I spent an hour reading it.  I read the reviews of the Ordinary’s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% and most people recommended was to use 1-3 droplets applied to a clean face.  I tried this method and it work beautifully!  I apply 2 droplets to my neck and face rapidly because of evaporates quickly.  The product and looks and feels like thick egg whites, however, 10 seconds after applying it turns into a smooth, moisturized and firm skin.I had the product to two weeks and skin please changed.  You’re exactly 2 weeks in between my photos.  I’m going to order more Original’s  products this week."

A year later, I start to break out and use some other products that did not work at all, and ending up just making me break out more. Then, I went back to this, and it worked instantly. I could see an immediate difference. I don’t have severe acne, but I was just starting to break out, and this is working very well. I would think it would work with severe acne as well. I hoped this helps, and that your acne can clear up."

A Great Black Skin Care Addition!",5.0,"I’m almost finished with the 1st bottle & just purchased my second. I have noticed an improvement in pore size & in my hyperpigmentation. I am a black woman with a warm/caramel/medium skin tone & I scar easily. I’ve had acne bumps leave dark spots on my face for years that I couldn’t get rid of. I now notice those spots are fading & even the tone of my neck looks better. I like that the serum is pretty thick so it doesn’t take much. I use about 2-3 drops max for my face. Before applying I typically wash my face, use a toner (witch hazel to prevent bumps) , hyaluronic acid (for moisture) & then apply the niacinamide. I’m excited to continue using this & see how much more my skin improves."

Great stuff!",5.0,"I have been using this product for about a year now and my face has completely changed. I had acne scar's from when I was young and they have significantly gone away. My pores in general have gotten smaller and my skin has a smoother appearance. That being said, while you're using it will actually bring out those scar marks more but that's because it's healing those spots and shrinking the pores. If you have the dedication to stick with it, your face will look a lot healthier and smoother in the long run. Better to do it sooner than later, because when your face is younger you have more collagen to help it heal faster. I hope this helps y'all."

Finally, something that works!",5.0,"I have struggled with cystic adult acne for a long time. I try every new product that comes out promising relief. Most don't work, a few work sporadically, but overall I've been disappointed with all products for acne.That being said, I love this stuff. It works better than anything else I've tried and has been most consistent. It heals cystic blemishes and takes the sting out. I use several other The Ordinary products as well and have been very happy with the brand in general. I am grateful to have found it."

Use for Perioral Dermatitis",5.0,FINALLY I have found a treatment for my Perioral Dermatitis and I couldn't be happier. I have tried so many The Ordinary products and none of them helped before this product.

Is it a fake??",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I decided to buy the Niacinamide 10% because this particular one was sold out everywhere else. This serum is good for minimizing pores and hyperpigmentation. I was a little worried because the reviews state it may be a fake. The packaging was a little beaten up but at least it wasn’t broken. Everything else seems to be legit. However it’s so overpriced. I recommend getting this product elsewhere."

I think I had been using it for a day or two. They said “wow your skin is so clear!” even though I had a breakout in one section of my face. My skin has a slight dewy glow even under makeup. Now I’ve been using it for months and still love it. I use it twice a day, only sometimes just at night."
