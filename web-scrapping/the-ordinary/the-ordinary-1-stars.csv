very disappointed, gave me breakouts and acne",1.0,"ok so i was very excited for this product. i mean it was the ordinary! the brand everyone talks about! i bought my first bottle in the beginning of july and used it until the middle of august until it ran out. i bought another immediately and used that about halfway into september. no change in my pore size, (which are def noticeable) and i also noticed ever since july i had been getting really bad acne. when i stopped using it, the acne went away. im very disappointed. i have another ordinary product, the red peeling mask, and it works really well for what i use it for (small bumps on my chin and sides of nose) so i thought this would work but i guess not. ü´§ü´§ wouldn't recommend but maybe its just my skin?  i was sad but oh well.another problem is how fast it ran out. its pretty expensive if your asking me and it took 1 1/2 months to run out. i used about a dime sized amount morning and night. maybe thats a lot but just putting that out there. i wish i could return it and get a refund but i already opened and used it. üòïüòïüòïas for the texture of the serum, whenever i was using it it was kind of sticky and i would rub it into my skin it would turn white... maybe it was expired but it was both bottles... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

NOT WHAT I‚ÄôM USED TO.",1.0,"So i‚Äôve bought this product before from Target, and it was PHENOMENAL!! It cleared my skin and kept me safe from breakouts despite being in a very stressful environment. However, upon buying this bottle, the product came very thick, creamy white (opposed to its runny, clear original) and smells off. I bought it due to Target and other stores that carry it are a bit far away. I‚Äôm very disappointed as I love this product and definitely think it‚Äôs the cause for my good skin, but I‚Äôm scared to use this bottle on my face. If you can, just buy in store!!!"

Not Authentic",1.0,"This Niacinamide + Zinc The Ordinary product from Amazon is NOT authentic.Please do NOT buy this!I was doubtful when I read the reviews on this, but they were all right. This in fact is not a genuine product. I decided to purchase the same product from Sephora and the differences are drastic. First, there is no gap on the fake of the bottle located below the cap. The ridges are larger compared to the authentic one.Secondly, the code on the bottle of the fake one is missing. There should ALWAYS be a code on the bottle, not the paper. When I tried the fake one, the serum itself left a weird sheen as if I left glue and eggwhites on my face. It smelled like glue and was not pleasant. The real one is a much thinner formula and had no odor at all. It left my face looking 10x better than the fake one.I guess you could say the one from Amazon was an imposter. They didn‚Äôt do their task right. Dang, they‚Äôre a good liar though!2nd photo: Amazon purchase on the left, Sephora purchase on the right3rd photo: Sephora purchase4th photo: Amazon purchase5th photo: Sephora purchase6th photo: Amazon purchase"

Terrible Experience - Buy from DECIEM from now on",1.0,"I ordered this product like over a month ago and i got an email and status update for it to ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù when it had not in fact been delivered (without a delivery photo even though i have the photo setting on). I received the item yesterday and I was feeling sketched out about it but I used it in my night-time routine before bed. Despite having put it in my skincare fridge to cool down, it was still funny smelling (like Elmer‚Äôs Glue) and i applied it prior to moisturizing. When it dried, i applied my moisturizer and the niacinamide on my face immediately started peeling like dried glue it was very unsettling. Idk if it was ruined by being in transit in the heat for so long or if the product is a sham or something but I do know that I will not be ordering TO products from amazon anymore. If you‚Äôre reading this, I recommend just buying TO products from the company website, Deciem. Never had such a bad experience with a product that I had to write a review about it but this is an exception."

Serum or glue ?",1.0,"Not at all what I expected. It has the consistency of glue and smells like it too. It feels like glue on my face and leaves a uncomfortable tight film. I will have to wash it off before applying make up. I'll try it for a while and see if it does anything.Update I couldn't use this product long enough to see if it does anything positive. As stated above it leaves an uncomfortable film on your skin. It also caused me to break out really bad almost immediately after I started using it. I stopped using it until the break out healed- and tried again, with the same result. 2 days and my skin broke out really bad. I'm done with this crap."

You tubers rave about it. Doesn‚Äôt work.",1.0,I bought this product for my breakouts in the chin/jawline area. I saw a ton of youtubers raving about it. I put it on right after I get out of the shower on my clean skin then I apply my face creams. It absorbs into the skin within seconds which is nice. Smells a little funky but it goes away so I don‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôve been using it religiously for 9 days now since I received it and i have not seen any improvement whatsoever. I have gotten new breakouts but nothing out of the norm. I will continue to use it in hopes that I change my mind but as of now I would not purchase again.

Made me break out",1.0,"It made me breakout, so I stopped using it. I use a moisturizer with niacinamide already in the formula so I figured this should be ok on my skin, but I ended up getting little pimples all over my cheeks and chin. I did also make sure NOT to use this when I apply my Vitamin C serum like it says. So I‚Äôm not sure why my skin reacted the why it did, but I stopped using it and my skin finally calmed down and is doing much better without it."

Damaged my skin barrier",1.0,"The first week of use it was great. I noticed my skin was nice and smooth. By the second week I noticed my skin was getting red. I was using it daily. And then my skin started to burn, and my regular products started to burn my face. My skin is dry and flaky. I‚Äôve completely damaged my skin barrier with this product. The dosage is just too high for me. I need something lower than 10%. I wish this brand sold it at something between 2-5%."
