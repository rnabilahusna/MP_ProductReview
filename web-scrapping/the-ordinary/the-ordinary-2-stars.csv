Already Opened!!",2.0,"I was so excited to use this product and I heard great things about it. However, when I received the product the packaging looked terrible and the product looked as if it has been used before. I hope that this was an accident and this is not a recurring problem. I am very disappointed and I do not feel safe using this product."

burned my skin",2.0,i dont have overly sensitive skin but this destroyed my skin barrier after a week. im pretty sure its a fake product so that might be why. that doesnt mean you shouldnt get the serum all together but buy it from the ordinary website as its a lot better of a deal and you know it isnt fake.

Be aware of your skin type",2.0,"I was super excited to try this product, but it actually caused me to brake out more. However that is just because of my skin type. I do have normal to oily sensitive skin so if you do I would not recommend but I have heard good reviews from others so it really depends on your skin. Packaging is really nice and cute:)"

Product irritated my skin",2.0,"This product was recommended to me by a nurse to hopefully heal the skin irritation on my face. Instead, it burned when I applied it and caused my skin to peel."

The product is fine, the price is wrong",2.0,"Okay, this is completely on me. I purchased this product after reading some amazing reviews only, and yes, it is very nice but what I didn't notice is that you can get it at Ulta for half the price. So I think this works best for somebody outside the US or with no access to a physical store."

Fake",2.0,I agree with others this product is fake. It curdled under my makeup. I tried to use it for 3 weeks to and I compared it to another bottle at Ulta. I would try it but be careful on Amazon. Amazon is known for fir having sellers who refill bottles.
