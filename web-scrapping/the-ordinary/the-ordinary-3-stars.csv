It's only been about a month , I'm still giving it some time :\",3.0,"Update ; although it made my skin very glowy(which I loved). Unfortunately,  after a little over a month. My skin is doing horribly. I'm not sure if it's the combination of products (cleanser,  toner , serum,  oil)  but I have about 5 new cystic pimple 😔☹😡.. but honestly due to the amount I paid and have left in the bottle. I will continue to use, in hopes that this is just my skin purging😫😒I have hormonal , acne prone skin. I've been using this a little less than a month.. I cant give a thorough review right now however. My skin looks worse now , this could simply be due to my acne prone skin alone, this breaking me out, or my skin purging?  I'm not sure. But I will continue to use it, hopefully it helps with my hyperpigmentation and breakouts. I did notice this in combination with a light oil made my skin nice and glowy, however I dont think it moisturizes alone."

Doesn’t clear up acne scars",3.0,"I’ve had acne scars for almost my whole life now, I thought this stuff would clear it up or at least reduce redness but all I got was dry skin. Also it’s cheaper to buy at ulta than it is on Amazon."

Irritated my skin",3.0,"I don’t know if my skin is just too sensitive, or if this product is a knock off of the original, or I don’t know why but it makes my skin very irritated. And I mean very irritated! I really tried to love this product because of all the hype that I’ve heard about it but it’s not some thing I have been able to consistently incorporate in my skin care routine."

LOVE IT but, I would recommend buying from Sephora",3.0,"I purchased this and when I received it, it was 1/4 empty. I don’t know if that was The Ordinary’s fault or Amazon’s but, I just ordered the same thing from Sephora and it was completely full- fuller than The Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid that I purchased from Amazon that was full (if that makes sense). Also, its $5 cheaper from Sephora for double the size. I love this product, use it everyday, and it has helped my skin TREMENDOUSLY."

Super-Hyped Product is Ehhh",3.0,"I’m just not fond of their formula, perhaps I will try from an actual retainer to see if there’s a difference. Specifically I do not like the consistency and 28 days with minimal improvements.I will say I prefer the COSRX at the moment, would recommend their formula.  Hope this helps."

Opened Product",3.0,"I ordered a new serum for my skin care, but when I opened the box I notice that the top of the product wasn’t screwed on all the way. I took the top off an notice hardening around the edges and spots around the serum. I have not used this serum before, but I didn’t notice anything wrong with the smell. When I applied the product to my hand to try testing it, I noticed it had little suds."

This product is very drying",3.0,I wouldn’t recommend this product. It is too drying and left my skin flaking. More importantly it didn’t help clear scars from acne

Meh",3.0,"This stuff is ok, I got it because of an esthetician on YouTube said it was good for acne. I don’t see a visible difference and when I put it on it gets a tiny bit sudsy, which I don’t think is meant to happen. I’d prefer an acne spot treatment, this feels unnecessary"

People LIKE this?",3.0,I've never had any sort of antioxidant serum that burned so bad or left me bright pink and irritated. Even if it works and has high active ingredient wtf is this suspension that's burning me? Idk if I can stand to continue use and wait for actual results. Neutrogena didn't burn my skin. What gives?

Made me Break Out a Little",3.0,"I bought this product after seeing a beauty blogger's review about it. Since I have hyper pigmentation from not using sun screen in my youth, I've been trying to find ways to stop or reverse it. I also bought and tried out other products in conjunction with this one as part of a skin care routine, but I noticed that my skin would break out in very small pimples sometimes. After testing and leaving out products to figure out what was making my skin like this, I discovered that when I stopped using this product, I no longer got those small pimples. My skin is somewhat sensitive, so maybe that's one of the reasons, or some ingredient I'm slightly allergic to? I'm not sure. But I wasn't completely surprised as I did notice my face felt just a tad tingly and extra sensitive after using it (even with just one drop, no more than two, each night). During the time I did use it, which was for a few weeks, I have about half the bottle left, I didn't notice my spots lightening or even staying the same. Actually, they got very slightly darker; even though, I used sun screen. I don't necessarily attribute that occurrence to this product though, but certainly I was disappointed that this did nothing for me even after being patient and using it consistently for a while to see its effects. Maybe it'll work for others as the other reviews seem to suggest."

Leaves a precipitous thin film that forms skin rolls when pressure is applied",3.0,"It leaves a thin film of some precipitous stuff on the skin that forms rolls when I apply pressure while applying foundation. To avoid getting “skin rolls (ew)”, I apply only a small amount in the center of the face in the morning. I’m wondering if it’s because of zinc, so I will try another product to see if the same happens.It looks like I got the real product, comparing off the other reviews. It’s quite moisturizing and thicker than other serums I use. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks, and I didn’t get any reaction. While there isn’t anything wrong with this product other than skin rolls, I didn’t know it’s supposed to be only $5 offline, so there’s another strong motivation to try other niacinamide products."

I have a question... is this legit?",3.0,"When I opened the packaging, I heard a pop and smelled something like paint. It looks like someone glued the cap on so it seems like the product was never opened. If you look at the picture you can see remnants of glue. So I don’t know if this is the real product made by The Ordinary, if this was made by the ordinary but it was returned and sealed again for sale, or if this is just a phony formula. Either way I am very worried."
