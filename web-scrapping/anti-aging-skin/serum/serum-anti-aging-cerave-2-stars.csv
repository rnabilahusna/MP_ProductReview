Too thick",2.0,"This product was too thick for me and I found it difficult to spread. I have a hard time even calling this a serum, it is definitely a thicker lotion consistency.  There are much better retinol serums at the same price point.",0

Didn't see much effect and RUBS/PEELS OFF!",2.0,"While the ingredients for this are not the worst, it does have PEG-40 and some other ""undesirables"".  The worst part, though, is that it doesn't soak into your skin, it just sits on top, dries, then rubs/peels off!  I've stopped using it in favor of more natural products.  I can't recommend this at all - I don't understand how it can get so many ""good"" reviews.",0

So far seems alright",2.0,"The box came pretty tore up/crushed in a way that almost makes it seem like it was opened and returned before. Luckily I gave sanitizing wipes but pretty disappointing for a beauty product. Haven't used it yet, plan to this week.",0

Sad to say I didn't like it at all...",2.0,I used it a few times; it left my face feeling sticky/greasy and did nothing for me. I understand that it takes time to see any noticeable changes but I really didn't like how it felt on my face/left my face feeling. I use other CeraVe products but this one did not do it for me!,0

Not a fan",2.0,"This may work for others, but it broke out really really bad after wearing this.I've heard of the retinoid uglies, so I stayed consistent and even used the entire bottle.the second I stopped using it my skin cleared up. It's worth noting that my skin is better than ever, so maybe this product changed something for the better.Nonetheless, I won't be buying it again.",0

Pump doesn't work",2.0,"I love this product and use it all the time.  However, when I got ready to open this new bottle, the pump does not work. (the reason for 2 stars)  It pumps, but nothing comes out.  I can't find a way (yet) to get the product out.  I had bought this to have when my other bottle ran out.  When it came time to use it, I was already past the return by date.",0

Unsure",2.0,I don't really know how to feel about this I was hoping that it would take my break out away. But it seems to not do the job .. I had high hopes for this cream.. I feel as tho it might actually be making it worse .. I really don't knowðŸ˜£ðŸ’”,0

Used Product",2.0,"I definitely love this product, Iâ€™ve bought product before at the store but decided this time Iâ€™ll buy it on amazon. Well, maybe wasnâ€™t a good idea. Item came used and I honestly donâ€™t know how to feel about this. Donâ€™t have time to return this Iâ€™m a flight attendant and am always on the go.

Awful rash that won't go away",2.0,"This product should have more of a warning. I washed my face with a mild cleanser and then applied a tiny amount of serum all over after I towel dried my face before bed. The next day I washed my face with water and applied sunscreen spf 30 and spent the day in the sun. 2 days later I get this awful rash that still hasn't gotten better after 4 days. I am applying a mild hydrocortisone which is really not something I wanted to do.  Apparently rashes are common but upon further reading - if I ever use it again - I would wash my face, apply toner and a mild moisturizer, let that dry for 30 minutes, THEN apply a tiny tiny amount just to my forehead to see if I react like this again. It's really awful and uncomfortable as you can see from the picture. :(",149

Not what is promised from a retinol product",2.0,I have normal to oily skin with few breakouts and fair complexion. I've been trying retinol products for a year now. This one did not feel comfortable on my skin. It feels too heavy and leaves more oil than without using anything. I don't like the scent either. I have tried two other retinol products for the same price point since this one and they were an enormous difference in both feel and retinol benefits. I do not recommend this one.,0

Different formula from the white pump packaging",2.0,"I just repurchased this serum and it came with the new purple top pump whereas my previous bottle came with an all-white top pump. I had a horrible reaction to this new one, but I can't find anywhere online saying they changed the ingredients. I ended up with hives from head-to-toe, swollen eyelids, swollen hands, and in the ER for a steroid shot. If they did reformulate, CeraVe really should have put that on the packaging or at the very least on their website.",2

Made my skin very dry...",2.0,"I haven't tried it yet but just based off of the packaging I'm rating it a 4. The box was torn and crushed in some areas, the bottle itself came with a lid that was unsealed, there was no plastic wrap or anything to show that it was new and had never been opened and used. As for the actual product, it absorbs fast and doesn't leave a sticky or greasy feeling and my skin feels a lot softer after using it. I'll update further after, or if, I see results.*UPDATE* Since starting it ten days ago, I haven't noticed any improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. I have noticed, however, that it has severally dried out my skin. It's a shame because it really feels like it makes my skin very soft when I first apply it, but after continuous use it starts to dry it out.",11

Not for sensitive skin",2.0,Definitely not for people who have sensitive skin. My skin IS still irritated very bad because of this product. Just used it 2 times I tried again 2 times after 2 weeks I stopped using to make sure if it's the reason and yep it messed up with my face again.,0

Caused minor breakouts",2.0,I have been using this product for several months. I havenâ€™t seen any change in my skin but I have had a few breakouts since using. My skin is not sensitive and I rarely have issues with products breaking out my skin so this product was disappointing.,34

Skin doesnâ€™t absorb",2.0,I like cerave products but this one doesnâ€™t absorb into my forehead. I dab on as directed but it doesnâ€™t dissolve Iâ€™m left with like a yellow foam that doesnâ€™t go away. Is this how this product is supposed to work I have no idea?,0

Breakout purging has lasted more than 3 months.",2.0,"I am 62 and fortunately have skin that has aged well. In order to keep the lines at bay, I have tried this serum for 3 1/2 months.

That has continued, and much to my dismay, I woke up with several new spots today. I am not sure why this doesn't work as well for me as it does for others, but I am getting tired of the pimples so will have to try a different retinol product.",0

Pretty disappointed",2.0,"I am pretty disappointed buying this product. In the duration of time I used it(30 days), there was no improvement. My face did not get lighter even with sunscreen protection. Instead my face got a bit darker and broke out more. I was also using this with the BHA which I was told it would be fine, but neither helped. I have used some of CeraVe products for a while, but realized their face products are not helpful to me.",0
