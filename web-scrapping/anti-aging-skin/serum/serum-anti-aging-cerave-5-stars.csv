Smoother, brighter, and more youthful-looking skin!",5.0,"CeraVe’s Anti Aging Retinol Serum is a powerhouse skincare product that has become a must-have in my routine. Here’s why it’s worth considering:1. Effective Ingredients: This serum is packed with key ingredients like Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, and Ceramides, which are known for their ability to address multiple skincare concerns. Retinol is fantastic for smoothing fine lines and promoting skin renewal, Hyaluronic Acid provides deep hydration, Niacinamide helps even out skin tone, and Ceramides strengthen the skin’s barrier.2. Gentle and Non-Irritating: CeraVe is well-regarded for creating products suitable for sensitive skin, and this serum is no exception. Despite containing potent ingredients like Retinol, it’s gentle and unlikely to cause irritation when used as directed.3. Skin Brightening: Over time, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin’s brightness and texture. Fine lines have become less noticeable, and my complexion appears more even and youthful.4. Hygienic Packaging: The serum comes in a pump bottle, ensuring hygienic and precise dispensing of the product. It’s also easy to control the amount you use.5. Affordable Luxury: This serum offers high-quality skincare at an affordable price point, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers.One thing to keep in mind is that Retinol products can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so it’s crucial to use sunscreen during the day while using this serum.In conclusion, CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum is an exceptional addition to your skincare routine. It combines powerful ingredients to target multiple skin concerns while remaining gentle on sensitive skin. With regular use, you can expect smoother, brighter, and more youthful-looking skin.",64

Keeps my skin clear and looking young",5.0,"I'm in my 40's and my skin has most definitely changed from looking young to looking... 40's.  After much internet rummaging and finding this had great reviews, I purchased, tried, and my final opinion is that it works great for me (I would guess that I have normal skin, sometimes it can be slightly oily but not by much).  I get compliments on my complexion again, which had stopped when my skin started to age.I always use sunblock when I use this product as my morning routine, also from CeraVe.  I assume since it has retinol, its that more essential to use sunblock to protect the newer, exposed, skin.",15

It really works!!",5.0,I’ve been using Cera ve and 5 other of their  products for about a month now- morning routine & evening routine they show in their description. About 2 months ago my 6 yr old granddaughter (out of the blue) told me I looked like I was 81( im 57). My health is poor and admittedly I have been letting my facial routine go. So needless to say I read allot of reviews of other products and landed on this one. What a huge difference in 4-5 weeks! My fine lines have diminished and my puffy eyes are improving. Granddaughter just told me I look 74 now lol. So something is working. I love these products💕💕,13

OTC Retinol That Moisturises",5.0,"I love all of Cerave's products, and this one is one of my all-time favorites. Yes, it may be a drugstore product, but that doesn't bother me I'm not a skincare snob. I have been using Cerave's Retinol for a long time now and not only does it absorb quickly but is so soothing for aging dry skin. I apply it every night during my skincare regimen and this product is very soothing and moisturizing. It is extremely inexpensive yet has many good ingredients and no fragrance, scent, or smell so it is great for those with sensitive skin or scent allergies. Please do not be deceived by the low price tag, this is a very special product and will not only moisturize your skin but works to keep wrinkles at bay. I absolutely recommend this gentle yet effective product at a fabulous price point to anyone seeking an OTC retinol product that won't dry out your skin, you have nothing to lose except perhaps a few wrinkles, and who doesn't want that? I have used Tretinoin but I keep coming back to Cerave because my aging dry skin loves it:)",46

Great product for the price",5.0,"I had seen a list of ""five best retinol serums"" in one of my feeds and the Cere Ve product was listed. It was by far the least expensive on the list and I love Cere Ve products in general so I thought -- why not give it a try? I really like it -- not at all greasy -- no scent that I can detect -- and no skin problems after use. I love how my skin feels and looks right after it goes on. I will continue using it.

I actually really like this product",5.0,"I didn’t expect to care enough about it to leave a review, but I have to say, it’s been the perfect introduction into retinol products.It’s got a silky moisturizing feel, and after using it for only two weeks, my skin is already looking a bit brighter, smaller pores, more even tone.. Nothing crazy, but I can definitely see a difference. Looking forward to continued use and I’m sure even better results. I have combination dry skin, and I’ve had no irritation. I put it on after my serums, and before my moisturizer at night (I don’t skimp either, I use plenty of it and work it into face/neck/chest). Love the way it makes my skin feel and look in the AM 👍🏼",19

Great for a beginner",5.0,"I’m 37 years old and moved across the country to a much drier climate and my skin was like a lizard! I never had dry skin before but started to notice my face was looking dull and even flaky under makeup. I was curious about retinol and nervous since I’ve had sensitivity to products in the past, but this one has hyaluronic acid which is meant to offset any reactions so I gave it a go. Started only applying at night and after only 3 nights I’ve already noticed such an improvement in the texture and appearance of my face!! My ilia tinted serum now glides on smoothly and the flakes are gone. No redness or issues. Glad I opted for this trusted brand and didn’t try to go for a pricier potentially harsher option.",34

This product really works!",5.0,"I have never used any retinol or hyluronic acid products.  But for the last few months, I was stressing over the vertical lines around my mouth and even consulted with a dermatologist about a painful and expensive laser procedure.  I happened to come across Dr. Sugai, a no nonsense dermatologist on YouTube, and after seeing his review of several retinol products, I went ahead and ordered his number one recommendation—CeraVe retinol serum.  He mentioned that retinol and the  hyluronic acid that is part of the serum  have  a slight plumping effect but I thought it was just a bit of hype.  But he seemed to know what he was talking about so I thought I’d give it a try.  I’m so glad I did!  After a couple of days of using the serum, I looked in the mirror and thought WHOA! —this stuff  really works!  He was spot on re the plumping effect.  It wasn’t hype after all.  For now I’m holding off on doing any laser procedures.  I only used a tiny  amount around my mouth and had  no adverse reaction to my sensative skin.",57

Easily ordered from Smaxon",5.0,"Lately, I have had some difficulty finding Cera Ve serum at retail.  Found that I could have it delivered through Amazon.The product, itself, is good.  I sm 73 years old, so do not expect miracles to happen to my face.  I like the ferl of moisturized skin, so this works well.  I do not bother with makeup at my age anymore (maybe gor a special occasion).",18

Amazing product",5.0,"I was hesitant to start on retinol since I have a very sensitive skin, but let me tell after a month using the vitamin c in the morning and this retinol at night my skin looks bright, glowing free of redness and looking younger. I do get few breakouts here and there but is worth it. Cerave is the best.",13

It works",5.0,"I had a rough 2 years working 80+ hour weeks, and my friends and family were quick to note how quickly I was aging (I'm barely in my mid-20s). I was recommended this product, and after nightly use for about a month, wrinkle lines stopped expanding and even began becoming less noticeable. I started to ""anti-age"" and look my age again (though I'd like to look younger).I followed the recommended use on the bottle and I've seen pleasant results.",20

WOW IT TRULY WORKS !",5.0,This CeraVe Retinol cream delivered in a day & a half.  And it is absolutely Fantastic!  I’ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks now & the difference in my skin is beyond what I expected !  It is smooth & you only need a few drops on your face.  For about 10-15 minutes it feels kind of greasy but then it is as if you never put it on !  All your face feels is  really Good !,7

Great product, slight difference, but not grand",5.0,"I waited to write a review on this to wait out for any results over time and here it is. Overall, I feel like the product has done its job and helped a little with my dark spots and skin overall. Personally, however my deeper skin issues are going to have to utilize a stronger formula going into tretinoin to see a larger scope of possibility, but I would recommend this product to anyone with minor issues. Overall, I'm happy I began with this retinol because overall my skin is a lot better.",10

Good product for a great price",5.0,I am 80+ and have been using retin A since my twenties. This product does the job and isn't expensive. I had been using ZO and other expensive ones but will not be doing that going forward. I mix it with Obagi Blender to keep hyperpigmentation away.,13

One of my favorites",5.0,"I have always like CeraVe products and this one is just as good as the rest. This retinol cream does not irritate my sensitive skin and it has improved my skin a great deal. I have very dry skin from menopause and diabetes and the works for me. I like that it is unscented as well since I'm sensitive to odd smells. This is not greasy or sticky, either.",14

Excellent Product -- Beware of One Seller",5.0,"As an older man, I've found that this retinol serum -- although it doesn't say what percentage or quantity of retinol is in the serum -- seems to help reduce and prevent facial skin spots that are common in aging; and at a relatively good price compared to many retinol products.  However, if you find that ""HappyLife4Me"" (but not for you) is to be your Amazon seller, beware.  In my experience, they were unreliable -- at best -- and I won't do any more business with them.  It'd be nice if the product was shipped directly from CeraVe or Amazon, but it can also be found at common drugstores and grocery stores.",48

The Retinol for Retinol Newbies (And Safe For Medium to Dark Skin!)",5.0,"I got my first bottle in December last year and by week 4 I knew I had a new skincare staple. I have dry skin made sensitive by a bit of Pinterest DIY mishaps BUT THIS is the best skincare purchase I've made recently. If you're young or you don't have a ton of interesrt in complicating your routine BUT you wouldn't mind establishing the foundation for longterm bouncy, clear skin...this is it bestie. No redness or peeling (I ive in a petty tropical place), very lightweight formula, smooth skin after 3-4 weeks, skin that bounces like rice cakes to the touch etc etc etc for this price point? It's almost been a full year and I'm on my 2nd bottle. If you're like me and you value competent, reasonably priced skincare that gives you bang for your buck, you've found it!I can't stop praising the product. Also melanated darlings, it doesn't lighten the skin as some skincare formulas can do to us. So stop reading and get it before it's gone!",70
