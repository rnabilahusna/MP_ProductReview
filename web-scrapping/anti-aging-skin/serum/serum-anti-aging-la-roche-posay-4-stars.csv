"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: La Roche-Posay Pure Retinol Face Serum with Vitamin B3. Anti Aging Face Serum for Lines, Wrinkles &amp; Premature Sun Damage to Resurface &amp; Hydrate. Suitable for Sensitive Skin, 1.0 Fl. Oz",27/09/2023,"4.0 out of 5 stars
MIRACLE",4.0,"La Roche-Posay is a renowned brand known for its dermatologist-recommended skincare products. Their Pure Retinol Face Serum with Vitamin B3 is designed to address multiple skincare concerns, including fine lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and texture. Here's a review of this product:Pros:1. Effective Retinol: Retinol is a potent ingredient known for its ability to improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and promote cell turnover. La Roche-Posay uses pure retinol in this serum, making it an effective anti-aging product.2. Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide): Vitamin B3, or niacinamide, is an excellent addition to this serum. It helps to soothe and strengthen the skin's barrier, reduce redness, and even out skin tone. The combination of retinol and niacinamide can address a range of skin concerns, from signs of aging to discoloration.3. Lightweight and Non-Greasy: I appreciate the lightweight and non-greasy texture of this serum. It absorbs well into the skin, making it suitable for various skin types, including oily and combination skin.4. Fragrance-Free: La Roche-Posay is known for its commitment to fragrance-free skincare products, making this serum suitable for sensitive skin that might react negatively to added fragrances.5. Dermatologist-Tested: The brand's dermatologist-tested claim adds a layer of credibility to the product's safety and efficacy, assuring consumers that it has been evaluated by skincare professionals.Cons:1. Potential Irritation: Retinol, especially pure retinol, can be irritating to some individuals, especially when first introducing it into their skincare routine. It's recommended to start slowly and build up tolerance to minimize potential side effects like dryness, redness, or peeling.2. Price: La Roche-Posay is a premium skincare brand, and as such, their products tend to be more expensive compared to some drugstore alternatives. While the quality justifies the price for many users, it might not fit everyone's budget.3. Sun Sensitivity: Retinol can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. It's crucial to use sunscreen daily when using this serum to protect your skin from UV damage.In conclusion, La Roche-Posay's Pure Retinol Face Serum with Vitamin B3 is a solid choice for those seeking an effective anti-aging and skin-renewing serum. Its combination of pure retinol and niacinamide addresses a wide range of skincare concerns, and its fragrance-free formula makes it suitable for sensitive skin. If you're looking to incorporate retinol into your skincare routine, this product is worth considering, especially if you value the quality and reliability of the La Roche-Posay brand.",27

Seems to work well",4.0,"This product is pretty damn good to tell you the truth. I have purchased only one bottle. It is almost gone. I do see an improvement in my skin. And, it's not just my imagination. Very very easy to put on, very nice aroma etc. Slightly pricey but, if it works it's worth it.

Good one",4.0,"I have a sensitive skin and the last time I used Neutrogena retinol moisturizer, I experienced breakouts and got two huge pimples. It still hasn't cured ü•≤. I slowly started introducing the skincare in my routine and waited so long to introduce retinol. After reading numerous reviews and research, bought this one. The only complaint is, the scent is a bit strong for me though it's mild generally. I have just used it for one day. Will update once I use continuously",12

Works Well On My Sensitive Skin",4.0,"I started using this serum after I did a search for a retinol that was sensitive enough for my neck, but still provided anti-aging benefits. I feel fully assured when I'm using this that I'm using a safe product on my sensitive skin while still receiving benefits of Vit A, B3 and hyaluronic acid. I'll definitely be repurchasing.",2

Retinol is a must have, not sure this is",4.0,"I am a 40 something woman who is a swim instructor and coach, dry acne prone skin.  Yes, yay -- not only do I have to worry about wrinkles and dry skin but also breaking out.  Sigh.At any rate, retinol is one of those must haves for fighting off the signs of aging.  I normally use Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM Night Serum and I love it -- it is in a blue dropper bottle and the retinol is suspended in a silicone base with vit C and E, and is at a 1.5% retinol.  I have tried many different types of retinol, but I always come back to this as I feel it is effective and doesn't further dry my skin.BUT it is pricey.  So when I saw this (I love La Roche-Posay sunscreen) at a much better price (currently almost half) I was eager to give it a try.This comes in a red bottle which I assume would protect as well as a cobalt bottle, however I still keep mine in the medicine cabinet to protect against sunlight.  It is also in a dropper bottle, but unlike the Roth version isn't clear, it is a milky yellow.  The dropper works well, dispensing one drop at a time, and a little bit goes a long way.  However, I find the feel to be much less appealing than the Roth version -- this is sticky at first.  It does soak in quickly and the tackiness disappears shortly.It is not nearly moisturizing enough for my skin.  I still have to layer it with a good moisturizer.I like that it is time released retinol.  I'm not sure how that really works, but it sounds good.I didn't have any redness or peeling from this product.  I also didn't have any breakouts or burning.My two main complaints are that I don't know the amount of retinol in the product (honestly, why do companies think it's OK to hide that?  I am putting it on my face!)  and there is a a very heavy scent to this.  The Roth has almost no scent . . . at least none that I can detect.  This has obviously added a floral scent, which is too strong for me.  I am not sure if they were trying to cover something up or if they thought it was a benefit to the product, but I would have really preferred it be left out.So I will probably be going back to the Roth version . . . despite the cost.  I with they would disclose what level of retinol is actually being used.  But since they don't (at least at this time) I don't want to wait until I start seeing problems to go back.",79

it's great for moisturizing but doesn't really help wrinkles",4.0,"My skin routine has included a serum for a few years now and I've gotten good results with this La Roche-Posay, which moisturizes as well as Lancome Genifique Youth Activating Serum and Givenchy Vax'in For Youth, both of which I use off and on, as well as Ginzeng and other Vitamin C serums. However, as far as the wrinkles and the younger appearance of the skin, it's not quite as good as either the Lancome or Givenchy. The smile lines which I'm fighting right now are a little more pronounced than they were with the other serums, and I think I'm going to save the La Roche-Posay for summertime, as I think it's a little too underpowered for winter.I'm 48 with pale skin skin that tends to be dry and is starting to show wrinkles and light age spots. My routine: I do a pretty harsh cleanse with Noxzema and tea tree cleaners because of a lifelong problem with acne, then follow with either a rosewater spray or Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence. When that sinks in, I do an Ordinary caffeine serum under the eyes and the Ordinary hyaluronic acid on the face. I follow that with a serum, often the Lancome or Givenchy listed above, but sometimes a Ginzeng or Lumine Vitamin C, then end with a heavy duty moisturizer in the winter like Philosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar overnight. In the summer, I use a lightweight Clinique. Under the eyes I'm using First Aid Beauty, because I don't want to use my usual Philosophy Miracle Worker at the same time as this La Roche-Posay, because of the retinols in the Philosophy.The moisturizing as I said above is equal to the much pricier products I use, but the wrinkle reduction isn't quite as good.I should note I only do this routine 4 times a week because, again, as much as I need this, if I use any of these products too often I start to get pimples. Doesn't matter the brand, it always happens. So it's very possible that this La Roche-Posay would work better if it was used daily, and I think for the price point, if you're looking for a better quality but not bank-breaking serum, I'd give this a try.It's been very gentle on my face and I've had no problems with irritation. There is a kind of burnt chemical smell to it but that goes away after about 10 minutes.",0

Better looking skin, I had no irritation",4.0,"I'm not new to using retin-A products, from over the counter available creams to prescription strength tretoinin prescribed by my dermatologist. I just always put up with the embarrassing redness and peeling because I was after the end results of smoother skin and improvement with fine lines and wrinkles. When I was given the opportunity to review La Roche-Posay's Pure Retinol B3 serum I was hopeful that it would be gentler on my skin and it is. The following is my experience with this serum.  I used this serum at night as directed. Using the dropper and dispensing a few drops into my hand, I applied it to my face. It went on smoothly and was absorbed completely into my skin, leaving no sticky or tacky residue to the touch. What was immediately apparent is that my skin looked much smoother and hydrated upon application. I'm sure this has to do with the complex formulation as retin-a itself takes time to produce results over time. Still, I liked how my skin looked and felt. I experienced no irritation. I can't speak to the overall potency of this product as I could not find on the box nor label, the strength of the retin-a used in this La Roche-Posay's Retnol face serum. I'm familiar with the La Roche-Posay's name and to be honest shyed away from purchasing due to their prices. That being said however, I have noticed a glow and more plump look to my face since using this product and that in itself makes me feel the cost is justified. I can comfortably recommend this serum especially if other forms of retin-A were too harsh for you. I posted some photos and truly hope that they, along with my experience, helps you out a bit with your choice. Thank you!",8

Moisturizes Well.  A Little Goes a Long Way.  Be Careful w/Sun Exposure.",4.0,"I've been using this serum for about a week now.  I apply it all over my face (careful to avoid eyes) at night after I wash.  I don't need to use a whole lot.  I place a few drops on my hand at a time (I only need to do this a couple times to cover my whole face and neck), so as not too use/waste too much.  A little really does go a long ways.I noticed it does moisture nicely, w/o leaving any tacky/greasy feeling behind.  I even used it on my forehead and it hasn't made it greasy at all.  The serum dries and leaves my skin feeling soft.There is hardly any scent to speak of and this serum doesn't bother my skin AT all.  Certain products can irritate my skin, but not this one.I did notice a warning on the bottle/box about sun sensitivity when using Retinol.  Basically your skin will burn easier when left unprotected in the sun.  This is pretty much the same with any Retinol product.  Just use a mild sunscreen to alleviate this problem.Overall this serum seems to work nicely.  I think that it's a bit pricey, but a lot of Retinol products are.",6

Good Formula for Those Who Haven‚Äôt Tried/Used Retinol in a While",4.0,"The Le Roche-Posay Retinol Face Serum is a good serum to use if you‚Äôre looking to smooth out your skin and remove fine wrinkles.  I haven‚Äôt used Retinol in a few months now and after trying this for the first time, realized I needed to use less product to start off as I started quickly flaking in the days following.  After easing off the serum, I used less under my daily moisturizer/sunscreen and have been pleased with the results.  My skin has been looking healthier, smoother, and the wrinkles and freckles are slowly starting to fade away.  This is a product that does take time and dedication as well as very liberal amounts of sunscreen applied.  The serum is slightly liquidy and easy to applie.  The dropper allows for precise control on how much you apply to your face and I‚Äôve found that it worked well with my combo/dry skin.  This formula has a lightly floral scent to it that quickly fades as it dries. Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for a lower concentration retinol to start off with, this is a good option to consider.",4

Works very well but a tad expensive",4.0,"I have been a Tom boy my whole life and not interest in ‚Äúgirly‚Äù stuff. However, since I‚Äôve reached the big 5-0, I‚Äôve been a little more interested in taking much better care of my skin. As such, I‚Äôve been trying different creams, serums, and moisturizers. I have heard of Retinol, so I snapped this up when I was offered it. I immediately started it when it arrived. I was blown away. After a couple of days, my fine wrinkles started to look less noticeable and my skin looked great. Be aware, though, that it takes very little to cover your whole face. I am not happy about the price, but if getting rid of wrinkles is a priority for you, this is definitely the one to try. Recommend!",0

Good serum, pleasant scent, but not strong enough for me",4.0,"I will have to add to this review after using this Retinol serum for at least a month regarding any improvement in lines and wrinkles, but so far I‚Äôm impressed with it. It goes on very smoothly and has a pleasant subtle scent, which is important to me as I am sensitive to odors in general. I have not had to use moisturizer at night after applying this. As directed I‚Äôve been applying every night.‚Äî‚Äî-Update 2/28/20:  After using this serum every night for almost two months I haven‚Äôt seen the results I was hoping for and think I may need a stronger strength, which I probably would have to get from a dermatologist. Meanwhile, I will continue using it as long as it lasts; it does seem to smooth out my skin at least and I have had no irritation or other problems with it.",0

Works Well - Pricey (As Are All Retinol Products)",4.0,"This is a good retinol serum.  It is not cheap, like $40 an ounce.  however, it is very oily and you really can spread a drop or two a loooong way, so go light.It does not have an odor. it does feel a bit sticky when applying but blends in well.  I do think it does diminish wrinkles slightly.  This, nor any similar product, is a ""magic bullet"".A few drops blended into your skin at bedtime after washing your face will probably yield some reduced facial lines over the course of 2-3 weeks.",0

Seems to Work",4.0,"I'm hesitant to give this serum 5 stars, but I swear, I think i really do see where some fine lines have almost totally disappeared.  I've been using it every day for over a week and surprisingly, my face looks smoother.  I'm in my early 60's and not very wrinkled but my skin does have fine lines.  I really haven't ever had a serum actually work before and believe me, I've reviewed a lot of them.  It doesn't moisturize my skin well and it's not too long afterwards that I have to apply a good moisturizer.  I'll keep using it until it's gone and if my facial skin continues to improve I will update this review.",2
