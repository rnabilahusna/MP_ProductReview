It did not work for me.",2.0,"Sadly this product did not work for me. It burned my eyes, and made my skin so sensitive and burned that I couldn't wear makeup for a week... it was the first retinol product I tried, so I can't speak to how it compares to others, but if it's your first try- try on a less noticeable area of your body but with sensitive skin like on your inside of your upper arms or something before you put it on your face. I wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for me.",0
