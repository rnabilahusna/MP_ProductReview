Some dramatic results so far",3.0,"I’ve been using this twice a day for a week. I love the consistency, just thin enough to spread easily and not pull the skin. My eye bags started puffing up so badly no matter how much sleep I got. I also have pretty deep crows feet and dark circles. Within a couple days the puffiness was GONE! The skin is soft and flat again. As far as darkness, I haven’t noticed any change yet. The crows feet are plumper but still there. I give the cream a massage into the corners of my eyes but maybe it needs more time. I’ll probably raise my rating the longer I use it.",17

Burns the skin around my eyes",3.0,"I'm sure it'll go away over time, but this product is burning the skin around my eyes and I usually don't have sensitive skin. Also, when the product came, it was loose in a box that was very damaged, like it had been smashed. No plastic safety packaging or anything. For all I know, this could be half gone, can't tell as the tube is opaque. I'll update the review after continued use as to its effectiveness.",4

Consistency of ...",3.0,"... Vaseline. I thought it would be a cream. Instead it's clear, and similar to petroleum jelly.It's too soon to see results as I've had it less than a week.It's not good under makeup because it works as a makeup remover, leaving my upper lids grey with mascara.I'll keep using it until I find something better. The search is on.",0

Not sure this works so great",3.0,This is okay but it's no panacea for aging skin.  My under eye area is very difficult to work with.  I'm still shopping for something that makes a difference.,7

meh",3.0,I didn't notice any difference with this overpriced eye cream. I wasn't expecting any miracles but it doesn't even feel moisturizing. The only positive I can think of is the tube; I like that it dispenses a small amount of product in a sanitary way. I'm not sure if it is recyclable plastic though. I really like other CeraVe products but this one is a miss for me.,6

What just happened!?",3.0,First time i have used this product.  I don’t use to many products and keep things simple.  I Like Cerave brand and have a few of their products. Sorry to say i used this one and about an hour later a small blood vessel broke under my eye.  I did not rub it in vigorously or anything like that.  I did not bump my eye or do anything else out of the ordinary. The only thing i did different was use this product. So now as much as i like Cerave I’m afraid to utilize this eye cream again.  I am now sporting a pretty good size black dot under my eye. Looks terrible and i read it may not go away. Hoping it does!!!!,3

Nothing special & ugly packaging",3.0,"For such an expensive drug store eye cream, I’d expect a little nicer packaging. I stopped buying CeraVe because of their ugly, boring packaging. When I do my skincare routine at night after a long day of being broke and depressed, I look forward to using products that look fancy even if they’re not super expensive. It seems silly, I know, but nice packaging makes me happy. I ended up buying similar price drug store brands that come in prettier packaging instead. Many even work better than CeraVe. The cream does nothing, and it dries out fast. I wouldn’t buy it again. It’s much better than the ELF eye cream for sure. BUT lower quality than Olay, ROC, and Pixi by Petra.",0

Feels nice",3.0,"I use a lot of cerave products and while I love the feeling of this eye cream, I haven’t seen any significant results. It’s not hydrating enough to use in the nighttime so I’m currently layering it with a thicker eye cream. For daytime it’s nice under makeup as long as I give it 3-5 minutes to really soak in.

Product consistency",3.0,Mixed reaction to this eye cream.  First tube I got was good and I felt it softened the wrinkles under my eyes so they weren’t quite so deep.  However the second  tube I received is not a cream at all -it’s an oil and I am not sure what happened but I didn’t open it until the return window closed so I am stuck.  As an oil it is completely ineffective.  Have reordered and will open the product  immediately so if it is an oil I will be able to return it.,2

But the texture of this is pretty thin, almost gel-like, and I don’t find it to be very hydrating or moisturizing. If I apply 1-2 layers, it dries down quickly like I didn’t apply anything at all. It does lay down nicely under my makeup, with no pilling, but overall, it doesn’t provide the moisture I want.

No miracles, but it definitely keeps my skin moisturized.I saw rhe new Cerave eye and texture products and started using them right away. I liked them, their ingredient lists were encouraging. I used both religiously for about a year, and I didnt really see much difference in either.  The texture one did work somewhat to diminish skin texture.Today I ead an article online entitled ""Shoppers in Their 70s “Don’t Look Their Age” Thanks to This Now-$18 Eye Cream Made With Caffeine"" Okay. Wait a minute. What were they doing that I hadn't done?  Maybe I wasn't looking carefully enough, but honedtly, I think I was.
