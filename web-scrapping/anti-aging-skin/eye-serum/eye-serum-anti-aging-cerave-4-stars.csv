Does the job",4.0,"I felt like it did the main job that I wanted from it; to moisturize my eyelids and the area around my eyes. I did find it to be very greasy compared to my old standby moisturizer. It did irritate one of my eyes, so I must have gotten some in my eye. That never happened before, even though I'm pretty sure that I got some of the old product in my eye a time or two as well. Because of this, I can't give it a five-star rating. It will do the job of moisturizing. I found the greasy nature of it to be rather annoying. The residue of grease stayed pretty much the whole day until I finally got irritated and rubbed what I could off. I wouldn't think that an eyelid cream should be like this.",3

Customer service",4.0,"More of a customer service rating than anything. My package was delivered to the wrong address in an apartment complex over the weekend, since people very rarely turn in wrong packages here. I placed a request for a replacement. They offered to send a replacement within a day. I wasn’t able to respond until Monday. In that time my package was turned in to our leasing office (much to my surprise). The seller was quick to respond, and very willing to make things right, even though not their fault. I very much appreciate that. As for the product itself, this is my third tube. I don’t know if it works any better than the expensive stuff, but I like it. Light, not oily, and easy on my sensitive eyes. Just what I needed.",0

CeraVe, I love your products",4.0,"Just like any other CeraVe products, this Eye cream is a good one too. My husband and I have using it, every alternate night and love the results.

Does NOT irritate!",4.0,Love that it does not irritate my eye area. Anywhere. And they are super sensitive. Had lid surgery and used it after stitches removed. No problem. I’m not sure it’s made any difference as there’s alot going on 🙄but it can’t hurt and will repurchase. I need to give it some time.-No scent detected. Amen,0

okay eye cream",4.0,"I purchased this after reading some reviews.  It's okay, but nothing earth shattering.  I see some improvement, but I also don't always remember eye cream.  I have had loose skin under my eyes for several decades and I was told loose skin would happen way back when I was 10 years old due to my ""bags"".  For the record, I have no other wrinkles (eyes, forehead or mouth), so maybe this isn't the best product for me, but I'm using it until the tube is completed and will maybe check out another eye cream that might help tighten my bags.  I don't feel over moisturized, and it doesn't take away my dark circles from rubbing my eyes due to allergies, but it may help someone with true crowfeet and what not.",4

Burns my eyes",4.0,"I don't want to give a bad review since I'm not sure of how well it works, but just wanted to give a heads up to my fellow friends with sensitive eyes - when I'd rub my eyes, wash my face, or anything that could bring a bit of this cream into my eyes at all - it'd burn quite a bit. I'm bummed out that I had to stop using it because it seemed like no matter how careful I was, it'd still happen. Leaving 4 stars because I didn't really see any reviews saying this, so I probably just have really abnormally sensitive eyes.",48

Feels Good",4.0,"Tried it every day for 2 months 2x a day am-pm using just a dab under each eye. The good thing is I had no reaction since I’m sensitive to many products. The bummer thing is, I saw no difference in the use of this product after 60 days. The before and after looked the same. Goes on nice, feels good, but at 61 yrs old, it’s hard to find a product that reduces eye wrinkles or puffiness.  Don’t drink or smoke. I’ll continue to eat clean,  take my supplements and just know age is part of the process.

Feels Nice, Absorbs Well",4.0,"As I've gotten older I've started realizing the importance of skincare.  I have a lot of early aging signs and though I welcome the process with open arms, I also want to do right for my skin.This eye cream is from a brand I've been trusting for several years.  We have many of their other products in our home so I was excited to try out this eye cream.The cream feels like more of an ointment that absorbs easily into the skin.  It doesn't act like a cream and I can't really dot it around my eye as the directions say to.  It's comfortable and feels hydrating with a slight tightness once fully absorbed into the skin.  I like the way it feels and I love knowing it's a safe brand I'm using on such a sensitive area of my body.I appreciate that it's unscented and creates no irritation despite the skin being more sensitive in that area.  I can see this being a good option for just about anyone regardless of their skin type.  It's safe to use twice daily and is supposed to help reduce the look of fine lines.  I can't say I've noticed any difference yet, but I still really like the way it feels.It's a little pricey for me but I've never been very good at spending money on myself.  It's a really small tube but a little goes a long way.",22

High quality",4.0,"My Shiseido eye cream was runing out. While waiting for it to be on sale again, I decided to try out CeraVe which was recommended by my friends. It worked pretty amazing with this price. Although it doesn't diminish the dark circles, it seems to help brighten my eyes. I'll probably stick with it for awhile.",0

Nice product",4.0,"I typically don't go for thicker consistencies in my eye cream products but I generally love CeraVe, so I wanted to give this a shot. I like how moisturized and soothing this feels on my eye area. The tube is easy to use and I like that there is a good amount of product for the price point. As always, CeraVe's ingredient list is simple and I don't feel bad about putting it on my skin. I feel good that my fine lines will be softened over time and I could definitely see this being a product I repurchase.",3

Specifically for wrinkles not puffiness",4.0,"This CeraVe Eye Cream for Wrinkles smooths out the skin around my eyes.  I’m 42 and don’t have many wrinkles but I do have under eye puffiness.  At first when I tried it I wasn’t impressed because it didn’t reduce under eye puffiness but then I reread the description and they have another style of eye cream for that.  I like that it doesn’t have a scent.  For the price and being a drug store brand, I’d expect it to address both wrinkles and puffiness.",12

Cerave Eye Cream for Wrinkles and Crinkles",4.0,Cerave is often recommended by dermatologists and I have tried many of their products. So I was happy to try this eye cream.I already had a tube of the Cerave Repair eye cream so I wondered how this was different. After reading the product description I realized the one I already owned was designed for dark circles and puffiness which I don’t have. And this one was designed for fine lines which I do have. So I was all in.The eye cream is fragrance free and lightweight. It absorbs quickly. My eyes noticed no irritation using it.I ran the ingredients through a cosmetics checker and saw that it scored a 3 for potentially comedogenic ingredients and a 2 for potential fungal acne causing ingredients. For that reason I deducted a star. It’s too early to tell results but i like it so far.,2

For wrinkles and under eye cream",4.0,"CeraVe eye cream is a gentle formula made to restore and moisturize the sensitive skin around and under the eye areas. I applied a small amount preferably a pea sized of the cream after washing my face at night to treat the fine lines, crow’s feet, and wrinkles. It’s non irritation and doesn’t have a strong scent which is good for the sensitive skin. I haven’t seen any progress with fine lines yet but the benefits of moisturizer is a great factor.",0

Feels nice",4.0,"Too soon to say how good this truly is and I'm mostly preventing, so it's hard for me to judge a product like this. Like most eye creams, it feels moisturizing. No undesirable feel. It has a somewhat unique texture like a creamy jelly. It is unscented. It arrived boxed but unsealed. It seems pricey to me, especially when a quick search shows the CeraVe Eye Repair Cream on Amazon right now is $13.49, but I know prices can vary a lot between different formulas of the same brand. I don't know enough to know if it's justified in this case.",0

Better Skin Quality",4.0,"An easy eye cream to use. It comes in a tube with a fine point tip that makes for very easy distribution. Squeeze just a small amount out on your fingertip and gently spread around your eyes. It spreads easily and absorbs well. It's a white cream that does not leave your skin feeling oily once it has set.Soon after application, the skin softens and fine lines are diminished. The eye area will look brighter and it helps to fade discoloration. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I've found that it doesn't seem to do much for puffy eyes. It will though firm up the skin and make the area look healthier.Good for all skin types and is just as good for men as it is for women.",3

works like expensive brands",4.0,I think this might be my favorite drug store brand.  This works as well as expensive brands. It helps with fine lines and dark circles. It can be worn day and night. I like the creaminess of it for the morning before I put on eye makeup.,3

Nice, non-greasy eye cream",4.0,"As someone who recently tested an eye cream that retailed for over $100, I can honestly say this was better. It's non-greasy, seems to reduce puffiness, and it even helps with my chronic dark circles. Wow. I wasn't expecting this. Very nice and even the packaging is good. (I am so glad I don't have to dip my finger in a tub and risk contaminating it.)",2

Hydrating",4.0,The eye cream was very creamy and rich. It smoothed on easily and left my skin feeling soft. It didn't leave my skin feeling greasy or tacky.  I didn't notice a scent to the product.,0

BEWARE OF PACKAGING",4.0,"Overall this eye cream is pretty good---works as stated. Problem is, since it is so small if you order from Amazon they put it in an envelope and while it was delivered where it is supposed to be the inside box was smashed. No way to protect it when sent in an envelope, that is why it lost one star.",2
