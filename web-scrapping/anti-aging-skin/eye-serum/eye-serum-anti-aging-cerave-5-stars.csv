Works and Feels Great",5.0,"This is a great eye cream. It’s kind of thick, like a balm. It is easily spreadable on the skin and absorbs like a dream. I kept squeezing the tube for more to apply to other areas of my face and neck.This is fragrance free. It played well underneath a layer of sunscreen (no pilling or balling up and shedding).I prefer this over the more fluid Cetaphil Eye Serum.I did not see an improvement in dark circles. I did not expect to see a dramatic difference for under eye darkness. I focused more on how well this moisturized the skin around my eye.This is firmer than Aquaphor Healing Ointment. It spreads easier than Aquaphor Healing Ointment and does not leave a glossy shine. This is lightweight and moisturizing and will work well during both the summer time and winter.",0

Effective and Gentle Eye Cream",5.0,"I've been using CeraVe Eye Cream for Wrinkles, and it's become a staple in my skincare routine. The combination of caffeine, peptides, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and ceramides is impressive.The cream is lightweight, fragrance-free, and ophthalmologist-tested, making it suitable for my sensitive eyes. It absorbs quickly, leaving my under-eye area feeling hydrated without any greasiness.After consistent use, I've noticed a reduction in fine lines and improved skin texture. The formulation seems well-balanced, addressing various concerns without causing irritation.The packaging is convenient, and a little goes a long way, making it cost-effective. Overall, CeraVe Eye Cream is a reliable choice for combating wrinkles, and I highly recommend it.",33

Love it",5.0,I actually am not a fan of Cerave products.  The cleansers and lotions break me out for some reason.  But this eye cream is excellent.

Cerave wins again",5.0,"I was looking for a good eye cream to combat my aging eyes which are showing their age, dark, and needed some attention. I started researching and CeraVe came up as one of the top ones and at some of the best prices. I have used CeraVe face wash for years and even my dermatologist has complimented me and said to keep doing what I'm doing so I thought, yea, CeraVe. I've been using it pretty regularly at night for about a month now and am noticing a real difference. The dark circles are definitely lightened and the puffiness is noticeably decreased. What can I say? You can't go wrong with CeraVe. Save your hard earned money and skip the expensive eye creams.",33

Very easy on the eyes",5.0,"I am a big CeraVe fan. My dermatologist recommended this brand.  I use their daily moisturizer with sunscreen and their night cream.  This eye cream is REALLY nice.  It is not scented but a nice creamy texture.  I use it day and night and it really smooths out a lot of my under eye wrinkles.  I massage it on outward x 10 and it plumps up my lower eyes really nice.  It even takes away some of the puffiness.  Love it.  Wish it was in a bigger tube as these smaller tubes tend to be expensive for the size.  I am 72 y/o and believe in retinol, a Vitamin C serum (I make my own), a sunscreen and a nighttime moisturizer.  My husband says my skin looks really nice.

Works perfectly! Better than expected!",5.0,"This brightens my dark circles and tightens the skin under my eyes; it always makes me look refreshed.At first I was kinda weirded out because I thought I looked so different with my dark circles barely visible, but quickly got used to it. The difference is that noticeable. Some people’s skin might react differently, so it’s hard to say if it’ll be as effective but if anything will brighten circles, this is it. Good value, good product.The cream has no scent and you just need to apply a small amount, I use something like a half grain of rice size drop and rub it in until it’s absorbed.- 26 year old male",21

Luxury not a need",5.0,I use this every night to help prevent wrinkles & brighten my under eyes. You only need VERY little to use this product. I gave a comparison for reference as to how small the squeeze container is for anyone who is questioning. I only just started this about 10 days ago so I see no real difference yet but again it's only been 10 days and aging takes a while. I'm getting into more skin care & self care so this is more of a luxury item for myself rather than a need.,16

Love all the CeraVe products",5.0,"I’m 72 so I have many “fine” lines especially under and around my eyes. I use this both day and night before I apply my makeup. It seems to minimize the look of the fine lines. Or I could just be fooling myself. Nah, it does help. All the CeraVe skin products I’ve used are really effective. I was asked what kind of skincare products I use. I’m told I don’t look my age. I was happy to say CeraVe. If you decide to get this, go for the night cream too, and the daytime moisturizer. I think you’ll be happy with the results.",38

It is good",5.0,"I’ve been using eye cream over the years and honestly I never found any improvement. I had to do fillers to have a real improvement. However, this lotion is a plus. Passing two years after my eye filler was feeling that the dark spot was coming back and I decided to give a chance for this lotion and for surprise is very helpful. I feel under my eyes much more illuminate and less “tired” appearance. You should give it a try. A lot of eye creams do not work. I tried skinmedica and alastin and was not worth the money. This product is way cheaper and delivers the results. I really hope cerave adds retinol to the formula =)",32
