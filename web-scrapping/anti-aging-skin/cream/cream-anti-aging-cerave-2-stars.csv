Leaves your face white, powdery finish",2.0,I like Cerave products and decided to try this one. The pump is not too efficient. Product is thick and creamy. I like that it has retinol and spf. It leaves your face white which I don't like. The finish is dry/powdery when it dries. Not a fan.,0

I canceled the subscription.",2.0,Allergic reaction to the product.  I don't feel that's correct. Then for whatever reason it was delivered & I want to return it because I had an allergy to it. I received a label & told at the UPS Store I had to pay for packaging & label.,0

Matte Finish— Not my jam",2.0,"I like a cream that leaves a dewy finish. This must have a zinc based sunscreen, because it leaves a whitish, matte cast to my skin. Not crazy about that. Feels wonderful though. Too bad.",0

Not very moisturizing",2.0,"This may be fine for oily skin but definitely is not for dry skin.  It leaves my face feeling dry and very tight.  I have to put another product over it to help with moisture. If you  have oily skin go for it.  If not, I would stay away from it.",0

Same Issue with Dry Consistency - Kind of like clay",2.0,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering this.  After trying this for a few days my first thought was that I maybe I got a stale or out-of-date batch that had been sitting on the shelf for too long?  I couldn't find any dates on the packaging, but the consistency is unusual for a moisturizing product, very dry, almost like a light clay.  And it does flake and pill when you apply it, even after letting my CeraVe vitamin C base layer dry for over an hour first.  Everything else in my CeraVe product line is fine, but this one either has a formula issue or an inventory control problem.",0

Leaves white film on face",2.0,"I bought this to use a retinol after work. The first time I applied it,  I had to spend a while rubbing it in to make the white glaze go away. However, it I rubbed to much, it would start to come off in small pills. I was going somewhere, so I had to rub it all off due to the uneven appearance on my face. I haven't used again.",0

Surprisingly heavy",2.0,"The pump didn't work so I did receive a refund. However, I did remove the top and used it.

How much is actually in the bottle??",2.0,"I found this product appealing because of the Retinol AND spf included.The product worked well.It never pumped out enough lotion to cover my face with one pump, always 2.I used it sparingly (as in 2-3 days a week) and within 1-2 weeks it was completely gone.I don’t think there’s enough product in the bottle to justify the price of the product.DisappointedI wanted it to be great ☹️",0

Love Cerave but this product is not it",2.0,"Have been using Cerave moisturizers and sunscreens for years and thought this product would be my holy grail since I am in my 30s and need a little anti-aging TLC.

Terrible product",2.0,"Very unhappy with product. I normally love everything I have used from CeraVe however, this product is substandard. It goes on very thick and is hard to get rubbed into skin. Once you get it rubbed in, it makes your skin look pasty and also makes your skin appear to have flake marks anywhere you touch. I wish I had kept the packaging so that I could return. Will have to start over looking for daytime moisturizer with sunscreen. This product is awful and I wasted my money!",0

The top is easy enough to take off, but the bottle is so skinny and the cream so thick that it makes it nearly impossible to get the product out.  Not only that, it dries up and doesn’t go smoothly on my face.  I’ll stick with the nighttime cream in a regular jar.  I wouldn’t waste my money on this.

Dumb bottle",2.0,"With the way the bottle is designed, much of the lotion goes to waste because it can't get it all out and it's very difficult to force it out once the bottle is partially used up.

It's a rigid container, so an encouraging squeeze is not an option. I finally resorted to using a chop stick to dip in and retrieve an application, and even with this method I will likely have to throw out a month's worth of unretrievable cream. I have, use and love many CeraVe products. Tell me where to buy this day cream in a jar and I'll buy it again in a heartbeat.",0
