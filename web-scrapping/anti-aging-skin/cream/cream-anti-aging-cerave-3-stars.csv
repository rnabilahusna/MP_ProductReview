i like it, could definitely be improved",3.0,"Pros- Doesn't break me out- Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin- Actually absorbs into my skin- Has retinol in addition to SPF, so a 2in1 combo, which is always a win for me- Has lasted awhile (I use once every morning, about 4 pumps)Cons- Can be hard to spread, be sure any previous product on your face is absolutely dry- Pills up sometimes, it's too thick. This has affected how my makeup lays on my face. I find that I sometimes have to go over with a thinner moisturizer after it has dried to get rid of it.- Takes a bit to fully absorb/dry. Nothing dramatic, maybe 2 minutes.Overall I do like this product, it's not perfect but it gets the job done as of now. Hoping there's a formulation improvement.",10

Inexpensive facial cream",3.0,I have used Clinique for about 30 years. Im sick of spending $70 on a jar of face cream to wear during the day. I thought because this was a name brand I would try it and was thrilled with the price. It goes on nicely and feels tight on your face but very dry. I have very sensitive skin so it may simply be my skin reacting. Im 75 years old if that helps.,0

Storing it upside down, hitting the top on the counter or floor, and using a cotton swab to get the product out is just too much to deal with.

Thick and hard to smooth into skin with an serious packaging failure",3.0,As others have said the product does not blend in very well but the worst thing is that the dispenser is severely flawed.  If the product were thinner the dispenser might work but getting anything out of that silly dispenser is a fight.  I store it inverted as the pump does not have a straw but even inverted you have to bang the silly thing on the counter multiple times to get anything to the pump opening.  Packaging failure.,0

It Doesn't Rub In",3.0,"I love that this product is good for my sensitive skin and doesn't agitate my face, but it does not rub in very well! When trying to rub it in, it creates little shreds like you're rubbing dried glue off your hands. Therefore, it does not necessarily moisturize very well because it's hard to get very good coverage when it's rubbing off.

Dries out my skin",3.0,I love CeraV and have used a few of their products. This one in particular I'm not too fond of because it dries out my skin and lips. I can't be sure but I think it may be the retinol addition to the formula. Its a very thin cream and goes on clear - sometimes i have issues with my face turning white with sunscreen. I do have to add an intense moisturizer first if I do use this lotion but I think i'm just going to go back to the original SPF formula without the retinol. I'm a one-stop-shop kind of gal and don't want to have to put on multiple creams if I can avoid it. I would recommend for anyone who doesn't have sensitive skin - the dryness is the only issue I have otherwise its a good cream. Its just not for me.,5

Love cerave this just isn‚Äôt it",3.0,"I was bummed out about this purchase - had bought it in lieu of their regular face moisturizer with spf that I use daily because I wanted the retinol benefits; when it arrived the silver part of the lid fell off and detached the pump from the tube in the bottle so now I have to shake the bottle in order for anything to come out. The product itself leaves a white residue that doesn‚Äôt blend with my face or if I put on a makeup it flakes right off.

I really wanted to like this product!!!",3.0,"I am a huge CeraVe fan.  I have been using their products for quite awhile.  Last fall I purchased two other CeraVe face creams, one with hydrolic acid and Vitamin C serum.  I should have stuck with those.  I needed a good day cream with Retinol.  If you look at the product (see pictures) you can see it is super thick.  Hard to spread evenly over your face.  Next, after it drys it looks like your skin is flaking or peeling.  I have to wipe it all off in order to put on my makeup.  What is the point in using this when I want a moisterizer to use under my makeup.

Pump Operation is Terrible; Verdict Out on Quality of Ingredient",3.0,"I haven't used the CeraVe cream long enough to see if it works on my face, so this review is just on its operation. As someone else wrote about this product's problem, the dispensing pump is Terrible and rates a ZERO. Even after vigorously shaking the tube, I could not get the cream to come down closer to the opening, so I opened the pump lid to see why--the pump stem is super short, at about 1/4"" long and the cream starts way below that, but wouldn't work anyway because the cream is so thick it clings to the walls of the tube. So I'm digging out the cream with the handle of my tongue-scrapper, which means air is getting in every time I use it. Next time I'll try the moisturizing lotion instead.",0

Too Heavy for My Oily Skin, even in Winter",3.0,"I've switched to CeraVe products for about six months now, trying to heal my acne-abused skin. I like their other Skin Renewing products just fine, their night cream being my favorite. It's heavy, but in the winter my skin needs that.However, for a day cream this is a bit too heavy for me. I have generally oily, sensitive skin and CeraVe's gentle products have made a difference for me, but this one is just too heavy for my oily skin. It blends in well, but I'm quickly greasy feeling again in a few hours. This might work better for someone with drier skin, or as a winter day cream.Overall: It's not bad, I'll finish the bottle, but I probably won't buy it again.",2
