Not great in winter",4.0,"I was excited to try this product - great reviews from a brand I love! But I was disappointed. I live in the Pacific Northwest, and in the winters, the air is dry and cold. There is absolutely no moisturization with this product. I’m using it for the SPF factor, but am laying it with another moisturizer.Once this bottle is gone I will probably buy another to try in summer, when it isn’t so dry. But I will definitely be looking for a new moisturizer.",3

Product great, bottle annoying",4.0,"The product itself is great. It is a perfect lightweight moisture, I’m never dry nor greasy using this. I also never get sunburnt on my face when out and about all day. I definitely recommend the product itself. However, the tube in the bottle never stays primed, so every day I have to pump it 30 times (no joke, I’ve counted) to get it to come out. Not sure what went wrong with this bottle design, I’ve used many CeraVe products and never had an issue. Hopefully they can fix it or maybe I just got a faulty bottle.",11

WHITE CAST, but super great quality.",4.0,"Somehow this cream is heavy but light? So my face feels protected & hydrated but never greasy. The white cast is kind of strong but actually works well if you are putting on makeup after, the cast creates a nice base. Very hydrating. Let it settle into the skin if you are using a cream primer it didn't work perfectly as other creams with mine but possibly better with a spray-on primer. Overall I prefer Aveeno radiant glow, but this is a nice substitute.",8

Great Customer Service!",4.0,"Check the expiration date on the bottom! Mine arrived expired, but I reached out to average directly and was reimbursed and was able to order one that was not. Also, if it doesn’t pump, there isn’t SUPPOSED to be a tube inside. They’re way of saving on plastic, I guess, but this is why I gave it 4 stars-it doesn’t want to come out! Store the bottle upside down and you won’t have issues. That said, it goes on easily, doesn’t leave residue, smells good, and doesn’t irritate my skin or clog my pores. As I have oily skin, this moisturizes my skin and protects it from the sun without making my face a grease bucket, and also creates a good foundation for makeup. That’s more than I can say for most other moisturizers.",14

renew your skin with 3 ceramides and sunscreen",4.0,"CeraVe Skin Renewing day cream is a nice, easy to apply face cream that also includes sunscreen rated SPF 30. Even if you dare to worship the sun, you still need to protect your skin from the damaging rays and this will help with your face and moisturize your face all at one time. The bottle is nice looking, not just a tube you squeeze stuff from. It glides on your skin and hours later, you can still feel it protecting your skin and moisturizing. It is almost like a barrier on my face. It doesn't feel greasy but you can feel it on your face. I like that it is non-irritating for sensitive skin which I have. This cream has ceramides, which is all the rage today. I always use products on my face and this may end up being my go to skin care product for daytime.",29

Great product but received with broken pump",4.0,"CeraVe products are wonderful, and at a great price point!The only one I have had trouble with is the Anti-aging Face Cream.  Again, the product is great - good sun protection, feels light, and moisturizes. However, of the four I have bought to date, two arrived with broken pumps.  The tube was broken at the top, meaning that no product would dispense.  I can get to the product be unscrewing the top and shaking upside down like mad. I think the plastic used for the pump tube should be more resilient.",15

One cream that does it all.",4.0,"I love this product. As others have said, the packaging is problematic. I’ve had at least one pump that did not work. Make sure the pump/lid is screwed on tight and a seal isn’t letting in any air. I don’t seem to have that problem with product I buy in brick and mortar stores.Aside from that, this product has become a daily requisite for my anti-acne skincare routine. It’s not really advertised as targeting acne, but I think the hyaluronic acid and encapsulated retinol are gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin while also providing very very mild exfoliation. I use the CeraVe skin renewing system in conjunction with mild cleansers and a natural witch-hazel toner. The ceramides leave my skin feeling firm, and used in conjunction with the night cream around my eye area and as part of my nightly routine, my skin is less irritated and break-out prone than ever. As I become more aware of my skin aging, I feel like I’ve noticed this product reducing the appearance of fine lines, and I hope the spf 30 will protect my skin and keep it looking youthful for some time!I also prefer zinc oxide barrier sunscreen, and it’s nice to have that and a moisturizer in one product so I’m not having to blend them. The very faint tint from the zinc oxide actually works almost as a primer layer for my powder foundation. Love this product, but there’s clearly a problem with its delivery.",34

Everyone’s face is different",4.0,"So I have rosacea that is very noticeable on my cheeks. My dermatologist recommended a cream over a lotion and recommended I try Cerva or Cetaphil. I went to CVS to see what I could find but Cetaphil didn’t have a creams only the face lotion but then I found the Cerva. The problem? CVS wanted around $25 which I refused to pay. So I went to amazon and found it much cheaper.Now the reviews did give me a moment of concern regarding the dispenser not working or it being heavy like a sunscreen.I decided that I’d give it and I’m glad I did. Now by no means is this the best product out there but for the price I was pleasantly surprised given the reviews. First my pump did work. Maybe I got lucky maybe they fixed whatever was causing the issue. Either way I’m glad. Now I did notice it was a bit heavy when I first applied so the next morning I washed my face, patted it dry and applied while my face was still slightly damp. Voila!! Took care of it! My only negative is that by the middle of the day I have to apply more as my rosacea dries out my skin like crazy, but that’s just me. For the cost I’d say give it a try.",5

Good protection but leaves residue on face",4.0,"I have been using this product for over a year now. It gives great protection and moisturizes, however, it leaves a white residue on face. Before each use, I would have to make sure to use a Moisturizer before applying this product. It is also difficult to wash off and may require a little scrubbing, as it will clog pores if not removed properly.I would say it does the job as a sunscreen protector well, and I would recommend for purchase (but also recommend that a moisturizer also be applied before use. )",14

A little drying",4.0,"I’m giving this lotion a second chance. I like the list of ingredients, but it feels too thick and dry and I have to rub it too hard to make it penetrate the skin. After it gets absorbed, the skin feels a little dry, like it doesn’t have enough moisture. I may have to mix it with my regular cerave face lotion to make it easier to absorb. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Not sure if I would repurchase.",0

Great Moisterizer, bad pump, weird smell",4.0,"I love CeraVe products and this one is no different. It does leave your face a little white but that's because of the sunscreen. I don't have a problem with it looking white once my make up is on. Overall my skin looks really healthy and I can see a difference in the texture.I see a lot of people complaining about the pump and while I'm 50/50 on pumps that work vs. pumps that don't I do understand why they package in this format. Spend a little bit of time reading beauty magazines regarding packaging of anti-aging products and you will quickly find that creams in little pots get too much exposer to air which deteriorates their effectiveness. By packaging this way, CeraVe is ensuring that their product doesn't lose potency. They could use a little work on the design though.My only other complaint is that it smells weird. Small price to pay for nice looking skin, but it's worth noting if you're really into that sort of thing.",3

One of the only sunscreen moisturizers I can use",4.0,"As others have said, store this upside down and it works fine. I have weirdly oily yet dry and very very sensitive skin, and I’m allergic to chemical sunscreens. This is one of the only moisturizers I can use. It doesn’t irritate my face. which is basically miraculous. The sunscreen is mineral rather than chemical, so it doesn’t burn my eyes.For those who say it’s too thick, I suggest putting it on right out of the shower. It mixes with the water on your skin and goes on smoothly. Or you can put it on just following a spray facial soother like Thyme Out or Mario Badescu lavender soothing spray. Again, it’ll go on smoother that way.This might not be the right moisturizer for everybody, but it’s one of the only ones that  my face can handle, so I’ll take it.",8

Great cream... don't love the bottle pump",4.0,5 stars for the cream. 2 stars for the delivery. I really like the cream especially that is has a decent SPF. The cream is really thick which is nice but because of the thickness the pump only works for like a week and then you have to turn the bottle upside done to store it or it won't pump out anymore. Luckily the cap has a flat top and you can just store it upside down. I'm probably about 3/4 through bottle and it won't pump anymore and I have to unscrew it every time and dig out the rest. They really either need to thin out the formula or change the pump!I like it enough and bought a second bottle hoping that maybe the first pump was just bad. I'll update review if I have a better experience second time around.,0

It is drying, but it is a sunscreen after all",4.0,"I have went through a couple containers of this product and I can confirm that it does apply like your normal sunscreen. It can come off as leaving a white film, but I have found that using a actual moisturizer like the serum cream or Nivea Men sensitive shaving balm before you apply this product, it goes on much better. The pump applicator is a bit annoying as well, but I haven't had any real issues. Maybe I'm just lucky? I've otherwise been very happy with this product thus far and will continue to use it.

Feels great, but who has time to reapply?",4.0,"This is a really nice product. It has a good creamy lotion feel going on and doesn't feel too oily. My face feels smooth and moisturized for many hours afterward.I bought this because I wanted a moisturizer that has SPF in it, but the downside is the instructions say you should reapply every few hours. I don't really have the time to keep putting more on all day long, and frankly, it feels wrong to add more when you are not able to wash your face beforehand, not to mention it would mess up most makeup if you tried.All in all, I like this product even if the SPF benefits are limited.

As the pump works on pressure - not a little straw thing - that seemed to do the trick.

More of a Sunscreen then a Day Cream",4.0,"Pros:@ Very nice packaging and pump.  Dispenses small amounts at a time.@ Built in SPF 30 sunscreen@  Noticed no skin irritation.  No overpowering scent.@ A little goes a long ways.@ Retinol  as part of the formula. If you are like me, you may have no idea what a retinoid is. The term describes vitamin A derivatives that unclog pores, boost collagen to reduce fine lines, and speed cell turnover to even out discoloration and smooth the skin—sometimes in as little as four weeks.Cons:@ Feels more like a sunscreen and less like a moisturizing cream.@ Leave somewhat of a tacky feeling it on your skin.@ Applies more like a sunscreen that needs to be massaged in well or you have a white haze. My overall opinion of the product… If you work outside a lot and need a sunscreen, this is a good fit with the added benefit of retinol.  If you are looking for just a day cream and don't need the extra sunscreen protection, there may be other better products out there for you with a more natural feeling.",0

Finally Found a Sunscreen I Like",4.0,"CeraVe is my favorite facial product brand and this particular CeraVe is a day cream with SPF 30. I normally hate to have sunscreen in my facial products or makeup because I really can’t stand the scent of sunscreen. Even though I do hate the scent of sunscreen, sunscreen is necessary for me when I’m out in the sun. The CeraVe’s scent is actually not as bad as a traditional sunscreen product. With the CeraVe, it is hardly noticeable to me. The texture and feel on your face is that of a sunscreen instead of the normal CeraVe facial moisturizer.This isn’t a replacement for my normal CeraVe moisturizer but I think I’ve finally found a sunscreen that I like and don’t mind wearing.",6

High-quality sunscreen with added benefits",4.0,"This product is first and foremost a sunscreen but I am surprised how well it absorbs into my skin. I had no problem applying makeup over it - just give it a few minutes to sink into the skin  - and it feels nice. There's no cloying sunblock fragrance and no white residue to blend. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks so I can't speak to any long-term improvements/benefits. I think my skin looks better after I apply it and I know it feels more moisturized. I am a big fan of CeraVe's lightweight PM face lotion so I'm not surprised this product is also a keeper.  While this is pricier than the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer face sunscreen I typically use (the Neutrogena sunscreen line is exceptional!), I like the added retinol this product offers. So far, I have not experienced any skin irritation. I will continue to use this product and update this review if my opinion changes.",2

effective sunscreen, but thick formulation",4.0,"CeraVe products come highly recommended by my dermatologist.  I have used an older version of CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion in a 3 0z pump container, containing 3.5% zinc oxide,  for some time, with success, and was happy to have an opportunity to try this Day Cream  The Cream comes in a 1.76 pump container.  Although the formulation is about the same consistency as the Moisturizing Lotion, the Day Cream contains a significantly higher percentage of zinc oxide, 10.5%, and thus feels thicker and more opaque on the skin.  The instructions for use on the Day Cream are identical to the instructions for the Moisturizing Lotion.  Although the Day Cream is no doubt effective as a sunscreen, t I found the texture to be a little heavy.  I also prefer the simpler, all-white plastic packaging of the Moisturizing Lotion.  product I used before.  The shiny metallic packaging is distracting",0

Omg the pump!",4.0,"I haven't purchased this on amazon, only from retail stores,  but i still use it nonetheless and it's an excellent product! I've used it for years. It makes my skin feel so soft and doesn't break out my acne prone skin. The only thing i don't like is the packaging. The pump doesn't work very well when you hit the halfway mark. It just pumps out air and i have to resort to unscrewing the top and digging the cream out with a q-tip. It is so annoying. I wish it came in a tube or something to make things easier,  because tbh, the pump is absolute garbage. Just saying.",0

Amazon packaging versus in-store",4.0,"So, I see the negative reviews and most are about that packaging. Don't get me wrong, packaging is a huge deal, especially if you are loosing product and this stuff is expensive.I recommend buying it at a store, as I have had really good success from the one I purchased - good product, good pump. I am half way through so maybe I will see issues towards the end of the bottle, but that is the nature of pumps - they never get all the product and I always have to unscrew and scoop for a few days.All in all -I really like it!",0

Can Be Drying",4.0,"Although this product boasts healing the skin barrier, I find that it can be drying, even when putting a moisturizer on prior. To counteract this, I tend to put on a heavier moisturizer than is my preference. Despite that, it is a good sunscreen, not the full 50 SPF, but adequate. I also like that there is retinal in this product and enjoy the overall ease of absorption into the skin. I would recommend, but caution those with very dry skin looking to boost moisture.",0

Good SPF protection with a high price tag.",4.0,"This is a great sun protection for your face.  Fairly decent without a significant scent and does not feel ""heavy.""  It also dries fairly quickly.  Price tag is fairly high and makes you wonder whether any cream with a fraction of the cost could do job just as well.  It is only 1.7 ounces, so it will not last you too long.  Factor in that this is a pump and that the bottle is not transparent, it is difficult to tell how much there is left and will leave you without sunscreen without a warning.",4

Product review",4.0,"I have used this product for several years, it does not leave a greasy,sticky feeling.  My primer does not pill when applied over the moisturizer. I'm assured of sunscreen with the spf it contains. The pump on the bottle can be problematic, it doesn't always want to function on new bottles and leaves quite a bit of product in the bottle when "" empty "", I use a q-tip to remove several more applications after the pump quits. The price point is favorable and won't break the bank.🙂",2
