Too expensive but works",4.0,"Female, age 60: I have invested in facial care for 30 years and it shows. I now have people insist I must be many years younger. I have used many compounds, including retinols. FACT: you do not have to spend $50/tube for good retinol. Talk to a dermatologist and consider a combination of alpha-hydroxies, hyaluronic acid, salicylic acid, and retinol depending on your needs. FACT: itâ€™s the chemical, not the brand, that matters. However, I will say this stuff works well and works fast. Donâ€™t put too much on, a little goes a long way. I just wish I didnâ€™t feel like a 1 percenter for spending this much. Itâ€™s really highway robbery, and Iâ€™ll swih to another brand hen I find a better priced option.",25

Visibly reduces pores within a week!",4.0,"Ok whoa. I bought this because I realized all of a sudden that I'm 33...blissfully ignorant of all that is vain...and then my husband  turned 40 and is aging like wine while I'm over here aging like an avocado. So maybe I should think about anti aging creams or serum or sorcery of that sort. So I got this to use at night, thinking maybe it'd fight off the fine lines. BUT WAIT! I've been using this since Monday (it's saturday) and my gigantic pores are VERY visibly reduced. I did not expect that! I've struggled with large pores since adolescence. I've tried sooo many things without any luck. I currently use a clarisonic daily and that has helped but not much. I had given up. But this stuff is seriously diminishing them! I can't wait to see How it does with a few months' use!I deducted one star bc omg the heavy fragrance in this stuff is something else! I'm practically suffocating from the fumes meandering off my face as I fall asleep at night! I hate that they perfume cosmetics so much. I'd honestly rather smell like whatever the ingredients are that they're trying to mask. Normally I'd refuse to use a product that smelled like this, but with what it's doing for my pores, I'll make an exception.",65

Impressed",4.0,I received a small sample and was so amazed I had to buy the full product. I accidentally used it morning AND night with immediate results after 2 days. Skin felt smoother and brighter. I am now using this in evening only and results are still seen although not as immediate as those first few days.Not sure how this compares with Boots No 7 Protect & Perfect intense serum since Redermic R contains retinol and the former does not but intend to try the Boots product after I finish this one.Only need a tiny amount of Redermic R when using it. Makes your skin sensitive to sunlight so be sure to use a sunscreen during the day. Amazon was the cheapest vendor that sold this product when comparing prices between online and physical drugstores in Canada and America. A good price is <$40. Average price in stores is ~$60.Update: La Roche Posay has great customer service. I had bought several products to help reduce the oil on my skin and none of the products worked (my skin got much worse). The drugstore I bought the products from wouldn't take the product back (don't blame them) but gave me the customer care number. LRP customer care took down the lot #'s over the phone and issued me a full refund. I was extremely impressed!,2

Does the job!",4.0,"I really like this retinol. The texture is great and goes on smoothly. I do use a moisturizer afterward but I have not had any issues with irritation. At first I wasn't sure if this was really doing anything for me but I didn't use it for about a week and my skin looked more dull...once I started again, my skin was back to soft and glowing with a reduction in fine lines and pores. My only gripe is that I wish it was fragrance-free.",3

So far so good",4.0,This seems to work well.  I bought it to use instead of retin-A which dries my skin too much.  I have not used this long enough to evaluate it fully.,0

Even Tones your skin",4.0,This product really did even out my skin.  I gave it a 4 star since I have to use it every other day for 1 month so far.  Within the first week I noticed significant improvement on my skin.  I have rosacea and there's nothing good for my skin but this La Roche-Posay Redermic R does work to make your face look even toned.  Unfortunately it does not take away previous red marks from acne scars.  It does make them appear less red though.  Make sure you wear sunblock the following day after using this product at night.  I love my new sunblock from AVON Anew with SPF 45.  Found both of these products to be great products from Allure.  I highly recommend them.,13

Always like a ROC product",4.0,I find the ROC brand to be quality. This feels good on and absorbs in without feeling greasy. I hate when a moisturizer feels like a film on my face  and this one definitely does not.  Odor is pleasant but not overpowering.,0

I had never heard of it before and was delighted at the results so much that I ordered the full size.  It works just as described and does not bother my sensitive skin.  My fine lines are much fainter.  I am a believer!,3

Too much fragrance",4.0,"I've only used this product a couple of days so I can't comment on the wrinkle reduction; however, I am very sensitive to smells and even though the fragrance is light it is too much.  This is the only La Roche-Posay produch I've used that has fragrance.  I was assured it didn't have fragrance when I purchased it.  This is a disappointment and I hope the fragrance will be taken out.",2

PRODUCT OK, BUT POOR PACKAGING",4.0,"When I received this product, the top was kind of smashed. Because of this, the screw on cap did not fit properly and the product came out all over the top the first time I used it. The cap will not screw back onto the tube, so I just keep it in a small snack size baggie. Other than that, the product is ok with no heavy perfumed smells, and even though I've been using it twice a day for about a week, I have had no irritation at all. I've only been using it for about a week; hopefully I'll start seeing results soon!",0
