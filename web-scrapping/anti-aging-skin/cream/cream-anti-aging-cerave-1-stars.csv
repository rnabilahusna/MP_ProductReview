Noooooo",1.0,"So I bought this product bc I have the cereve skin renewing vitamin c serum and it is the best freaking thing ever! It‚Äôs like putting silk on your skin.  Well I needed moisturizer and decided to try a new one, and I thought this would be great bc it‚Äôs in the ‚Äúskin renewing‚Äù line up, has ceramides AND sunscreen built in.Well no. Just NO.  Not good at ALLLLLLLL.  I like a thick creamy moisturizer bc I have dry skin, but this stuff is like almost chalky? It‚Äôs literally so dry when you pump it out.  And then it pills IMMEDIATELY upon touching skin.  Like don‚Äôt even try continuing to rub it in bc you will just end up with little balls all over your skin and hands.  I‚Äôve tried applying it on top of certain products only, no products at all, on top of a super moisturizing face oil and nope.  Every time just awful!  And on top of it all, it doesn‚Äôt even moisturize.  I look super matte after application.  I‚Äôm done trying to like this product.",2

Pills terribly!! Would not recommend!!",1.0,"UPDATE:I would not recommend this for ANY use. I finally gave up on using it for my morning SPF, and tried to use at night etc as a retinol cream. No matter what I do, it pills terribly. I have tried so many different combinations in an effort to use a product I spent money on in, but nothing I do works. I would not recommend for any reason and am changing my review to one star.Original review:I have only used this product for a week, but I feel that I can give a preliminary review at this point. I purchased this cream specifically for a daily SPF. I have been on the hunt for an inexpensive SPF that can be worn under makeup, which is quite a tall order for products <$20 USD.After a week use, I would not recommend this cream for anyone who uses multiple products in their pre-makeup skin care prep, or for anyone who uses medium to high coverage foundations. Reason being, it pills. It pills if you put on a light layer, or a thick layer. I have waited anywhere between 15-30 minutes after applying to give it time to absorb, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to make any difference. It pills without even touching the skin, which is something I have not previously experienced. Another reason I would not recommend for use under makeup is the drying effect, which I‚Äôm sure is the retinol. My skin is quite used to AHAs. I chemically exfoliate regularly. Even with skin that is used to a rigid routine, I find that the cream dries my skin out significantly. I must use a separate moisturizer mixed with it, or after. This is not necessarily a negative, however. It means that the retinol in the cream is a higher concentration, and will yield results.The reason I gave it four stars is the price and the quality. If you don‚Äôt wear makeup, or if you wear a BB/CC cream, I would totally recommend this for a daily SPF, or as a separate retinol cream. It is very difficult to find a cream that has an SPF, that sinks in and doesn‚Äôt leave you greasy, and that includes a retinol high in the ingredients list for less than $20.I will update my review as I get more use out of the cream.",7

Worst face cream ever!",1.0,"Something is off with the consistency of this face cream.  It goes on very thick.  Even if I wait 10-15 minutes after I apply the cream, when you touch your skin, say to apply makeup, the cream starts to clump up into little balls.  Then I have to brush it all off of my faces & clothes.  I was looking for a new skincare routine and had hoped CeraVe would do the trick.  But I am totally disappointed.  I cannot  be the only one to have experienced this with this product?!  I am beyond the return window, so I am just going to throw it away!",0

Can't Get it Out to Know if It Works or Not",1.0,"This is a very thick lotion. The pumping nozzle doesn't go down all the way and it stopped working after the first use. I took the pump off and tried a qtip once but didn't keep going. I even tried leaving it upside down for a week with no luck. I cant get enough if the product out to tell if it works.

This dispenser is terrible!",1.0,"I have always liked CeraVe products and will use this now that I have scooped it out of the unusable dispenser into a different container, but it should not be this way.  This pump did not pump at all!  Unfortunately I did not open it and use it before my return period had expired so I had to cut it open with my Dremel tool and put the cream into a new container.

Shouldn't even be called a face cream",1.0,"I really love CeraVe's Night cream, so thought I'd try this day cream. They couldn't be any different!

negatively surprised",1.0,"I was surprised in a bad way to see that the consistency of the cream is really hard. I had to look at the naming of the cream as I thought that I was mistaken and I was applying something other then a day cream. It is not easy to apply at all, you have to push to distribute it all over the face. It does not moisture the skin at all (although I do not have a dry skin). Plus the whole day I had white particles on my face so that co-workers were asking what was wrong with my face. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this cream to anyone.",0

Disappointing",1.0,"I absolutely love this brand and use their products all the time, which is why I am so surprised that I didn't like this at all. I wanted to use it during the winter months to provide me with greater moisture and I liked the 30 spf, bc i figured I don't necessarily need the 50 that I usually use at other times. I'm mostly indoors during the day.First, when I put on the product, I didn't like the consistency. It doesn't come on smooth, I had to pull at it quite a bit which is a big no for me in my skin care routine, as I don't like to have to yank on my skin to put on a product. Next, it leaves a white residue and does not blend in well at all. Plus, the residue isn't just the color, but also a sandy like texture of little white things all over my face. It left me looking pale and sick. I do not recommend this product at all.",4

Bottle doesn't work",1.0,I have ordered this product before and really like it.  You can't see when you're getting low so you order it in advance.  This bottle will not pump out.  I even put my pump from my other bottle on it.  I am very unhappy that it is now too late to return it but that I can't use it.,0

Dispenser is defective :(",1.0,"I just received this.  Had ordered instead of my usual brand, because I'm so happy w/ the other CeraVe products I've tried so far.  VERY disappointed that when I tried to use it for the first time this morning, the dispenser doesn't work, so now I have an $18+ container of product that I can't use.  Hoping I can get a refund or replacement.",21

Not moisturizing, does not work under make-up",1.0,Makes my skin feel even more dry and leaves a residue that doesn‚Äôt blend with makeup.  Even my highly moisturizing BB cream over the top doesn‚Äôt make up for it.  I‚Äôm bummed because I really like other Cerave products I use.  I am going to give it another try this summer.,4

Disappointed",1.0,"Not sure what went wrong. I bought this with a hydrating face wash and night cream from the same brand. After one week my face has red, dry, flakey splotches all over. I had high hopes because of the reviews on all of these. Afraid I won't be buying again.",0
