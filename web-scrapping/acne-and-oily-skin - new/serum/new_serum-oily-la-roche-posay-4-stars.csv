Not a fan of the smell",4.0,"I will have to update as we are new users of this product. I purchased for my daughter to try as she breaks out on her forehead during her sports season. I do use other products from this line and so I can offer some insight from that along with one complaint of this specific product.1. I do not like the smell at all. I get the push for fragrance free, less additives but, for me i prefer a light natural pleasant scent. This smells bad, like chemicals or medicine. I am not thrilled to place that scent on my skin but, know it is a temporary inconvenience.  If it serves a purpose then I can look past the scent.2.  The product is a little thicker, not watery. A little will go a long way so don‚Äôt feel like you need to fill the dropper. I would say to cover your entire face and neck you would need a third of a dropper full or less.3.  Not that you would use this product daily but, if so, I would say with proper portions the bottle could last you two to three months.4.  I feel their products go on a little slimy but, blend in pretty easy with no unpleasant residue. My skin does not feel tacky after using their products.5.  The price is a little expensive but, if it works and for the longevity of the bottle I would not complain about the value for your money.",0

Good stuff",4.0,I have bigger pores and got this to try help shrink them.  I have noticed them and am half way through the bottle.  I put it on every night after shower and cleaning my face.  Sometimes it stings but I assume because its working  .  It has rubbing alcohol smell to it.  I would get it again because for it it has worked out.  It helps me with controlling oily skin as well.,2

Great for Acne and Fine Lines",4.0,"I'm 31, and suffered with hormonal acne after going off of birth control over the summer. Now that I've got my acne reasonably under control with antibiotics, I have been left with a lot of post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation and being 31, am extremely self conscious. I have always had great skin, and now I look like a teenager post-puberty.  I had read about Effaclar in New Beauty magazine and decided to give it a shot. This product is really great. While it burns a little bit, it's great for plumping up the skin and smoothing out the overall texture. I haven't noticed a drastic reduction in my PIH, but the redness is somewhat reduced and this product is one of the only products I can use for fine lines that is also effective on active breakouts.  My mother even commented on the improved texture of my skin and wanted to know what I'd been doing.  Overall, a nice little serum.  Will be purchasing again.",21

Works well",4.0,"This whole line is great. Im a 55 year old athletic male, play a lot of tennis outdoors and work as a public speaker. The key is to use it at night. If you live in a sunny area and use this during the day you might experience a bit of photo sensitivity.",17

Great pharmaceutical brand!",4.0,"I love La Roche-Possay. It is a French pharmaceutical brand. Their products are sold only in pharmacies in Europe. They do not irritate your skin. Do not have any smell. This very serum is ok, but my skin is tough as well, so I am not the best example. But the brand itself is great. Pharmaceutical brands are more effective than cosmetic ones.",0

Absorbs Quickly",4.0,"So far it's still too early to say if this works, I've only started using this less than a week, but it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a sticky residue, I have loved all the La Roche Posay products, so I am sure this wouldn't disappoint me down the line.",0

It's Decent; Love La Roche Products, Though.",4.0,"I really love La Roche products and have used most of their Effaclar line and only use their sunscreens. This serum is decent for my skin. It did help with clogged pores and some blackheads resurfaced in order for me to get them with a comodone extractor without breaking the skin too much. It didn't dissolve the blackheads for me personally. The enlarged pore I have on my nose has also been clearer and this is always a nightmare for me to keep from getting clogged.I didn't notice much of a difference in my skin as far as re-texturing and I cannot use it during the day at all because it makes me very oily no matter what with big pores, even with oil controlling powder. It might just not be strong enough to do much for my skin that has a lot of pitted scars since years ago so it's why I didn't notice much of anything as far as re-texturing; I probably need laser treatment at this point. I had to take a break from it for a week because my skin was making way too much oil and I was able to narrow it down to this product being the cause. I've already gone through 3/4 the bottle. This is just my experience with it and I'll have to figure out how many times I can actually use it per week.I'll be continuing to use it at night until it runs out but I'm still probably be on the lookout for a better chemical exfoliating serum that I can use day and night/every night or what I've been doing now is using a Vitamin C serum during the day now that doesn't make me oily.",0

Excellent",4.0,"Love La Roche Posay, and love this serum.  Going on my second bottle.  I use it every night after cleansing with a Clarisonic, then follow with the Toleriane moisturizer.It burns a little in the beginning, but after two or three days it stops.  It feels like a very light oil, and I can feel it washing off with water in the morning. I don't use it during the day - it doesn't feel like it would work under makeup.  It makes the skin shiny when it's on.Like the other reviewer, I apply pretty close to my eyes, and it doesn't bother me.My skin looks better the next morning, and if I stick to it, a week later it's just glowing, even-toned, and supple.  I am a 40yo with combination skin and a few wrinkles here and there, and occasional acne.The bottle was lasting well when I was using it just on the face, but I got so excited with the results that I started spreading it down to the neck and cleavage and the back of my hands as well, so now it's going a lot faster.",31

Great for acne prone skin",4.0,"I'm not sure I this product does anything to minimize my pores and I don't have any fine line yet, but it does help to keep my skin clear. This product is not oil free! And that's why I was afraid to try it. But! If you do have a pimple it goes away overnight. I use it every night before my Est√©e Lauder advanced repair serum. It burns and stings a little but those feelings go away rather quick. As long as a moisturizer is used on too, this serum is not drying. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I don't think it does anything for my pores. But I've been only using it for a few weeks. If I don't discover anything better by the time I use it up, I will repurchase.",2
