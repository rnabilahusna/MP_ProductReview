Not Doing What It Says",2.0,I have used this product for one month now.  It has not lightened a few spots on my face.  Not even a little.  I expected to see some change due to the natural changing of skin cells but nope.  I'll finish this purchase just as a moisturizer but will not purchase it again.,0

Caused severe breakout",2.0,"I tried this for a couple weeks as the only change in my skin regimen, as I'm trying to reduce acne scarring.

Dried my skin",2.0,"I appreciated the size of the container, the brand, and the consistency of the cream itself. It's not too thick or thin, it doesn't smell, and the applicator is easy to use. However, this product did dry out the areas of my face I used this on.

Doesn’t work",2.0,"CeraVe Retinol Serum is a light lotion, not a true retinol serum. I wash, apply the CeraVe, then apply a light moisturizer before bed. By morning my face is chapped, indicating that both the CeraVe and moisturizer had evaporated completely while I was sleeping. I am now applying a light cream after the CeraVe. Either way, the CeraVe has had no effect on the texture of my skin. The CeraVe has been both harmless and useless. As such, I don’t see the point in buying it again.",0

Not for sensitive skin",2.0,I expected this to be scent free like the other CeraVe products I use but it isn't. It has a very strong smell.

2nd bottle STINKS like a petroleum refinery! Fake?",2.0,"I have used and loved several Cerave products for years. Speaking of years, I thought perhaps I had enough years on me that I should try this retinol serum in an effort to improve the appearance of both fine lines and adult acne. I liked the first bottle enough to order it again. I don’t remember the first bottle having much scent or smell at all. This bottle STINKS. Like a petroleum refinery. Thankfully I only smell it when it’s fresh and near my nose, but yuck. It doesn’t make me want to put it on my face. It makes me wonder if it’s contaminated or counterfeit — or if I need to question my confidence in Cerave. I also don’t notice much of an effect beyond a little moisture.",0

Very strange experience",2.0,"I have oily to combination skin, acne under control with dark sun spots on my face & larger dark areas on my neck. I’ve used Differin for over 2 years so my skin is use to a retinoid. The purpose of this product was to reduce dark spots. At first I thought it was my imagination but after 5 uses over a 2 week period specifically on my neck, my dark areas became darker & looked like they were spreading across my neck more. I know this seems out there but this was the case. I continued to use it thinking it would stop but it didn’t so after 2 weeks of use I totally stopped using it. It’s great this works for so many people but my experience was just the opposite. I use a lot of CeraVe’s products as well. My personal experience.",0
