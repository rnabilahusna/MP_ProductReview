La Roche-Posay, you can do better",2.0,"I really wanted to love this product, but denatured alcohol is way too high on this ingredient list and I could‚Äôve told you that without looking through it. I can immediately smell it as soon as I open it. Alcohol of this nature is not good at all for your skin! Such a stripping ingredient is NOT helpful to get rid of fine lines and signs of aging. Everyone knows that hydration is key to reduce the look of fine lines. I love other products from this brand. The 3-step effaclar line for acne was my skin savior!...I will finish this out by applying to the oiliest part of my face because I don‚Äôt want to waste product and applying moisturizer soon after, but I will not be repurchasing until it is reformulated without Alcohol DN.",7

I feel like it worked the first 2 days and I was elated.  Now, over 2 weeks later, nothing.  I am more disappointed that I got my hopes up more than the cost of the product.  If anything changes, I will change my review.",10

Wanted to like it, but it burns...",2.0,"Unfortunately, this product burns when I put it on my face and continues to sting after long after applying. Not very comfortable. There are quite a few La Roche-Posay products I use daily, but this one is not right for me.",2

do a patch test because this stuff can burn real bad.",2.0,"I bought this at CVS. I have combination skin, large pores, and acne. This stuff gave me a chemical burn around my mouth. If you want to try it, do a patch test because this stuff can burn real bad.",5

NOT FOR THOSE WITH OILY SKIN OR CLOGGED PORES",2.0,"I had mild acne before but now that I am beginning to go through menopause, my skin is really breaking out and pores are getting very clogged. This product is a real pore-clogger, so if you have the same tendency to have your pores clog up, beware! I looked at the ingredient panel and this product contains hydrogenated castor oil! Castor oil is very, very oily and in fact, is taken internally to produce bowel movements. Why on earth would anyone put castor oil in a product that is supposed to be used as part of the acne line? I had saved my receipt in case I had problems with this product (I do that with all cosmetic products) and I took it back to CVS and got my money back.  I would never use this again, but am seeking help from a dermatologist.  If you tend to break out and have clogged pores, I do not recommend using this product.",7
