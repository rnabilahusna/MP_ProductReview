Serum is cloudy....yuck!",1.0,"I have purchased this product from other retailers, it's supposed to be clear. I received this product two days ago and opened it and immediately noticed the serum is cloudy. I tried to initiate a refund, citing a defective product, and the seller said it can't be returned. I would not recommend buying this expensive serum from this seller at all as the product is contaminated and they refuse to allow a return two days after I bought it.",3

Rash",1.0,I used this product on my back and the next day I woke up with a really bad rash all over my bad. It wasn’t itchy but it was very irritated and red and I had tiny little bumps all over my back. It took three days for them to finally disappear.,0

it BURNS",1.0,"this stuff made my skin extremely sensitive. I only used it for 3 days and as soon as it makes contact with your skin it starts to burn. the sting doesn't go away either. it lingers all day. I couldn't even touch my face without it hurting. i couldn't rub my eyes because it felt like I was rubbing them after handling jalapenos. my skin started pealing as if i had a sunburn. this stuff was terrible and did nothing but mess up my skin. Also, i didn't apply this liquid on the skin around my eyes yet even my eye lids were pealing. be cautions of this product as they also do not offer returns and it is very expensive.",3

Not the same",1.0,"When I purchased this, I thought it was just new packaging, but this serum is very different from the original Effaclar Serum that was giving me such fantastic results.  I can’t find any information to show comparisons and differences.  Im not sure if I should be returning this for a refund and looking for something new or giving it a few weeks.  Im finding mixed reviews.",2

Don’t Buy it!!!",1.0,"I love La Roche Posay, but particularly this product is the worst: too much alcohol, my eyes were crying, caused me a breakout in my face... I tried it per 5 days to gave it an opportunity and was the worst decision. Glycolic B5 serum its by far so much better.",3

My skin did not like this :(",1.0,"I really wanted to like this, after reading all the reviews. But immediately after using it my skin started breaking out. I have not experience breakout with the other La Roche products (effaclar cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen). So I know this was the culprit. I got pretty bad breakouts from this. My skin is combination, with large pores and a tendency to break out. I have removed this from my routine, and no more breakouts. Also, reading the ingredients I found this has alcohol in it, which I didn't like too much.",7

Disgruntled User",1.0,"I am really disappointed in this product as a savvy health and beauty care consumer.  The price is expensive, but not if the product performed effectively for pore-refining, anti-aging and clearing of acne.
