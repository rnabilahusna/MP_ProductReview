No scent, works well",5.0,Love this product for aging skin. I don't have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this. I will say that if you have any sores or trouble areas it can cause a very temporarily stinging sensation but it's not long-lasting or problematic. Its a great product and my skin looks so much better when I use it regularly.,11

Excellent results",5.0,"I am very pleasantly surprised with the results of this so far! I'm in my mid-40s and fair-skinned. Sun damage and age spots were starting to take over my complexion. I've tried so many expensive creams, serums, facials, etc with little results. Decided to try this based on the number of reviews and I was not disappointed. After less than a week of using this in combo with their morning facial moisturizer w/ SPF I already see a noticeable difference. My skin is hydrated, so much softer, and I can actually see the discoloration fading! I am shocked. I use it once in the evening, and you don't need much. A heavy application may irritate sensitive skin. I hope this is helpful for someone in a similar situation, I'm so happy that I tried this.",144

It works!",5.0,"CeraVe Renewing Serum has become a staple in my skincare routine. It addresses a range of concerns, from fine lines to uneven skin tone, all while being gentle and affordable. If you're looking for a reliable and effective serum that won't compromise your skin's health, I highly recommend giving this one a try. Your skin will thank you!The texture of the serum is lightweight and easily absorbed, making it a breeze to incorporate into my daily routine. I apply it before my moisturizer, and it layers seamlessly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. Over time, I've noticed a significant improvement in the texture of my skin ‚Äì it feels smoother, looks more radiant, and the fine lines around my eyes have visibly diminished.Another noteworthy aspect is the packaging. The pump dispenser ensures that the product is dispensed in controlled amounts, preventing waste. The opaque bottle also protects the ingredients from light and air, maintaining their efficacy over time.",43

It's Helping- Smoothing Rough Texture & Pores",5.0,"I had oily skin as a teenager and young adult and now that I have much more mature skin I still have the aftermath of large pores and some shallow acne scars from those earlier years. They kind of create a rough texture that I would like to smooth out. This product contains retinol which can be beneficial to minimizing pores. Since I was new to this product I started out gradually to let my skin adjust--using it just several times a week at first with a day or two between uses. Then every other day for awhile. I apply it at night after removing all makeup and washing my face. I make sure my face is thoroughly dry before applying a thin layer of retinol product. The product comes in a solid plastic pump container. I find two pumps is sufficient to cover my face. Sometimes retinol can cause some flushing for first time users if this happens back off for awhile. I haven't experienced any issues, but then I built up my tolerance gradually. It absorbs pretty quickly. I will let it set on my skin for awhile and sometimes apply a dye-free, fragrance-free moisturizer to drier areas.  Again that is just me you may or may not opt or need to do that. I rinse or wash off the retinol product in the morning and apply sunscreen to protect my skin. I have pretty much gone through my first container and re-ordered a 2nd container of product. I find that it has helped to minimize my pores some and my skin looks somewhat smoother. My tinted sunscreen and makeup go on smoother and don't settle in my pores as much. I hope with continued use my skin will just get better. It takes patience sometimes and just remember depending on skin type results can vary. I hope some of this information is beneficial.",16

Gentle on my skin and works!",5.0,I‚Äôve had this for a few months and it‚Äôs the 1st retinol I‚Äôve used. I have combination skin but not sensitive so I put 3 ‚≠êÔ∏è. It doesn‚Äôt have a smell and has the texture of a light lotion. A derm dr said this one vs the purple bottle was the better one. I use it 2-3 times a wk. I‚Äôve noticed a difference especially when my skin is hydrated. I use vit C on the other days. FYI: you can also combine w/ hylauronic acid but NOT Niacinimide Make sure to wear sunscreen when using this! I‚Äôd definitely recommend and will continue to use.,3

Where has this been?",5.0,"I have cystic acne which leaves my face horribly scarred. I needed something that would heal some of my scarring.Now, I am realistic. This is not going to cure the deeper, thicker scars from repeated offenders (recurring cysts). Nothing will, short of a deep chemical peal. This, though, it smoothed out my skin and faded most of my scarring. My face is smoother now than it has been since pre-adolescence when the cysts began. I almost can't believe it. Retinoids really are what they're cracked up to be.I couple this with vitamin C serum and nightly moisturizer. Before that, I wash my face with benzoyl peroxide and treat with a benzoyl peroxide cream when I have particular aggressive breakouts.Sounds like a lot but then going out in public without makeup on for the first in years is also a lot.",75

It does what it says, you just have to be consistent",5.0,"I'm finally giving this a review after using up my first bottle and I actually reordered my second one. That's how much I like it. I have sensitive skin and I hate the feeling of residual residue on my skin, especially on my face after applying anything (hence why I rarely wear make up). I'm in my early 40s and noticed that I've been getting sun spots (which I like to think are ""freckles"") on my checks which were never there before. I don't buy anything before reading reviews or doing research on it. had enough position info on it that I took the chance.Price was decent for the amount. One pump goes along way and does cover the entire face and under my chin area. Very light feel on the skin and absorbs fairly fast. No linger smell/fragrance, which is a huge plus for me! No irritation or side effects, but do note that if you exfoliate or cleanse your face too often then applying this there will be a slight burning sensation (because this did happen to me) and it does go away in a few mins. I used to use this everyday right after I shower in the evening, but I upped it to morning and evening. Remember to put on some sort of sunblock. Follow its instructions.I like the results that it's giving me. My face looks more even, toned, moisturized, and my pores seem to have diminished a little in appearance since I first used it. I don't get little dry patches on skin on my checks anymore due to the harsh water here in Houston, TX. Again, it's really based on your skin routine, how consistent you are, how well you follow its instructions, and be realistic with your expectations. Overall, I like the product very much and will continue to use it so I hope it never gets discontinued :)",201

Works Slow, Use at Night!!! Affordable Beginner Retinol",5.0,"Love how affordable and good Cerave products are, so decided to try this as a ""dipping my toes in the water"" type of retinol product to help reduce fine lines and acne scars. After using this for a few months, here are some tips I'd like to share:- DO NOT start nightly if you've never used a retinol product before! Your skin needs time to adapt to new routines. I would recommend using once a week, then twice, etc., eventually you can use this safely every night.- It does not specify, but I DO NOT recommend using this during the day, or if you really, really want to, please use sunscreen. This is because retinols are not as effective under sunlight and it causes your skin to be more sensitive to UV light, which will cause more damage long-term.- This works pretty slow compared to other retinols. I found it to be quite mild, so don't expect your ice pick scars or enlarged pores to show any difference any time soon. You really have to create a consistent skincare routine to see change.- DO NOT stack your Vitamin C, AHA/BHA toners, and acne products with this. I made this mistake when I first started using the serum and woke up with sensitive red skin with breakouts. Now I only use Vitamin C in the mornings, apply benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid as needed when not using this serum, and tone with AHA/BHA a couple of times in the week during the day- You should still moisturize, this serum isn't a replacement for face cream. Your skin will only create more oil if it doesn't feel hydrated, so if you have oily/combo skin, find a non-greasy light moisturizer, but don't skip it!It's not a miraculous holy grail type of product, but I found that with consistency and patience, there are some visible results, so I will keep buying since it's non-prescription and not too expensive. My skin looks more smooth now, but there are still scars, so I think I will incorporate micro-needling into my regimen as well. This is a good product to add to your skincare routine, gentle enough to start using in your 20s. I wish I had known about lighter retinol products sooner - I used to think it was only for older people and that they are always harsh.",198

Miracle Serum",5.0,"So I had some pretty bad cystic acne over the past couple of months, but managed to get rid of it with the Differn Gel and A LOT of water. However, it left a lot of bad dark spots behind in a few areas on my face. My Vitamin C serum wasn't helping a lot, so I found this. I was hesitant despite the good reviews, and the success of the other CeraVe products I have. Despite this, I caved in, feeling pretty bad about the acne scars and dark spots left behind.Holy shirt. Just holy shirt. It worked IMMEDIATELY the next day the dark spots were already fading, and after about a week of consistent use they're almost entirely gone. I can't even see them unless I'm really looking for them. My mom was surprised to see they were pretty much all gone. I haven't been using the vitamin C serum or other products in the past week either due to dry skin, but I'm not sure if this was caused by this or the Differn gel. So it's been solely this and some of the PM moisturizer. I desperately wish I took before and after pictures of my face because it was so bad before.The only thing I would complain about is the price fluctuations. One week I was looking at it and it was 15, another 35, and when I got it, it was 20. Don't get me wrong it is beyond worth it. But I know it's going to suck when I run out, and waiting for a good deal on the price will be a pain since I try not to spend over 30 on face products. Other than that it's literally perfect! 5 stars :D!!",66

Good for combination skin",5.0,"I use this every night as part of my regular skincare routine, and it's helped so much.I originally used it as part of my morning routine, but I am a very fair skinned person and it made me super sensitive to the sun. It honestly made it look like I had the start of a sunburn after about 30 mins outside. But that's on me as it does warn about sun sensitivity.My face is oily at the forehead and very very dry at the cheeks and chin. I also still get frequent acne despite being old enough to know how to file my taxes. This has helped even out my skin so much, and seems to really help control my breakouts when I do get them.Sometimes my skin stings very slightly after using it, but it doesn't seem to dry my skin out at all. I do use a moisturizer after using this, so maybe that's helping. The smell is kind of something though. 9 times out of 10 I don't notice it at all, but when I do it definitely makes me think twice for a split second. Once I thought maybe I hadn't washed my hands after touching a wet dog, but it turned out to be the serum and not the dog. Even if I noticed the smell every time, I would still use it daily.",32

She very quickly gave me the name of a cleanser, this retinol and of course recommended a facial sunscreenI have been using the cleanser and this retinol for maybe 3 weeks and I can honestly say I saw a big difference in just a weeks time.
