Love! But too small.",4,"It looks so much bigger in the pictures, honestly I was pretty disappointed when it came and I opened it up and saw how small it was. But that is my literal only complaint. Once I started using it I love the way it feels on the skin, so smooth and soft and I love the smell and it’s perfect for my combination skin. It is just pretty expensive though for such a small bottle.",14

Perfect Moisturizer for Warm, Humid Climates",4,"For those with oily/combo skin this is the perfect moisturizer for NYC summers, or any hot and humid climate. This is literally the ONLY moisturizer I can use in the summer alone, or under foundation that doesn't make me look as though I've washed my face with bacon grease. I'm giving it 4 stars because I do experience a slight burning when wearing it, especially after washing my face with the La Roche- Posay Purifying Foam Cleanser. I also find that it's not the most effective for colder, dryer months. This past winter I've been added a little bit of vitamin E oil to the moisturizer and it's helped combat dryness and reduce redness/burning so perhaps this product just needs more vitamin e. Overall, because of the burning sensation I can't wholeheartedly recommend this to those with sensitive skin, but if you have oily skin I would definitely suggest giving this product a try. I'll definitely be re-purchasing since summer is right around the corner.EDIT: after going two weeks without this moisturizer i noticed my skin has been going CRAZY. i never realized how much this controlled my oily skin until i stopped using it. like they say, you never miss it 'til it's gone... i'm still going to stand by my original 4 star rating because of the slight burning sensation but otherwise this moisturizer is going to be in my skincare arsenal forever!!!!!!",3

I really like La-Roche Posay products",4,"I really like La-Roche Posay products. They are pricey, but they work better than anything else I've found. Let me say I really like the packaging of this product, it's supposed to be mattifying and the packing is mat, I like details like that. And it's easy to use, the moisturizer is a wonderful texture, cool, and not at all greasy or irritating and I love it. My skin is a combination of oily and a few small dry patches, but it's very very sensitive. The skin around my eyes reacts to most products, leaving me with a stinging or burning feeling, even moisturizers that people swear are great for sensitive skin. This moisturizer has never been anything but nice and smooth, and that's a big deal for me. I did take off one star because of how expensive it is for such a small amount, and because I haven't seen a difference in how oily my skin gets by the end of the day, and it's usually pretty oily even three hours after I cleanse and tone my face. I can't speak to how well it sits under makeup because I don't really wear makeup on a regular basis. Bottomline, if I could afford it, I would use this moisturizer every day, and if you have the cash, and you have oily or sensitive skin, you should try it too.",28

Great product - Price is too high",4,"This is my go-to moisturizer for oily skin. I was having so many issues with my makeup separating on my face, and the humidity in Florida. I later learned it was because I was using the wrong moisturizer. Once I started using this one, everything immediately was solved. Feels great on the skin, dries fast, no scent that I can tell. The only downfall is that there isn't much product, and it's expensive. I wish this would be changed, I can't really afford it anymore.",7

Mixed feelings. But does moisturize",4,I have mixed feelings about this product. I probably won't buy again. Does it moisturize. Yes. It feels light. And a tiny amount will spread over an area. I small dab was enough to moisturize my entire face. And it had no scent. In all it was pretty effective.My problem is that on days that I shaved (every 2-3 days) I had to use an after shave balm. I think the combination of the two products would clog my pores as I would break out with a pimple or two in the areas where I shaved and applied this moisturizerWhich kind of defeats the purpose of non comedogenic. On days when I don't shave it worked as intended and was a nice silky coat. But on shave days I could reliably count on getting a zit.  I switched to a different moisturizer on shave days. And have experienced no zits. Which again verifies that there's a problem using it with my after shave balm.It is a good product I can't knock it.,0

Goodbye grease",4,"I have nightmare oily skin that constantly makes me look shiny and feel gross whenever I go out[also in private but I can hide behind the blinds inside]. while I don't think it's done anything for my acne, it's definitely helped with oil! I no longer constantly have to wipe excess oil off my face and my skin is smooth and moisturized instead of greasy and oily. It also helped with pore appearance and skin texture[feels much smoother]. While, for the price, I definitely wish it came bigger or at-least with sunscreen to knock something else off the list. But I'll still definitely get another! It's not a part of my skincare routine.The only reason I dock it down a star is, while it could be a defective product, when I first got it and I squeezed some out to use, over half of it came out as air?? Good thing I only need to use a little but still.. Literally over half of the bottle was full of air. I'm hoping next time I'll get a more full one and it'll turn out to be a defect but until then it'll stay at 4 stars.",42

Not Quite Holy Grail, Not Bad",4,"I am still holding out hope for this moisturizer. I’m on the hunt for a unicorn apparently. I have that lovely rare combination/oily mature skin that continues to be acne prone in my 40s <grrrr>. I’m looking for a weekend product I can use to moisturize, that doesn’t leave my skin shiny, and doesn’t irritate my eyes (somehow everything I put on my face ends up in my eyes).  The first day my eyes were irritated so and I was convinced it was this, but I’ve since given it another try with little to no eye irritation. It does moisturize adequately without causing breakouts, I love the matte and somewhat forgiving finish, but I can’t figure out how to apply so it doesn’t ball up and crumble off my face :(. Again, it has many great attributes for me to give it less than 4 stars, but I can’t give it 5 stars. Still looking for my holy grail.",5

Holy grail! Just wish it was bigger for the price.",4,"I love this for its mattifying effects. I was worried about it breaking me out because I’m a bit sensitive to silicones (dimethicone) but I just made sure that this is the only product in my routine with dimethicone and I only use it once a day. I needed something to mattify because my favorite sunscreen is pretty dewy on it’s own. It is a great consistency, no overpowering fragrance, doesn’t pill, and gives a matte look. My only complaint is that it’s very small for the price! Would love a bigger bottle. But there’s nothing else out there like it so I keep ordering!",2

I didn't try anything else from brand except the mineral sunscreen, which I semi liked.  This caught my eye because it says it helps with oil control by continuously absorbing oil.  Since Amazon was having a promotion, I jumped on it.  This actually is pretty good.  I tried using this under my Missha BB, L'Oreal Pro Matte or sunscreen.  I noticed that my oily-ness showed later compare to when I use Dramatically Difference Gel or Domohorn Wrinkle Intense Hydrator.I have severe allergies, and due to pregnancy I don't take my antihistamines as regularly as I should.  So I don't really smell anything for this moisturizer.  This goes on smoothly, absorbs really quickly, even faster than the Dramatically Difference Gel.  I've been using this for a few week, I haven't broke out from this.  I would recommended this to ladies and gents with oily skin to give this a try.",0

Matte all day but be careful if using primer after",4,"One of the top moisturizer for oily skin that I have used! The only reason that I am rating this as a 4 and not a 5 is that I have found that it reacts with many primers (for instance, I’ll put primer on my face after this and then my face feels like it had eraser shavings and it gets clumpy etc). This has happened with various primers: Lancôme pro base, Laura Gellier mattifying, benefit poreprofessionals to name a few. I know this can double as a primer but sometimes I want a little more! I have tried waiting 15mins before apply primer but that’s just a thought. I still love this and alll continue to purchase!",4

Not as good as I expected",4,"This feels really good on the skin, almost like a moisturizing primer. My skin is super soft and silky when I put this on BUT it doesn’t help to make my skin any less oily. It’s not as matte and oil absorbing as I thought it would be (especially for the price) and it also can make my makeup slide around a bit and I use Estée Lauder double wear foundation so it’s not cheap stuff. Idk... since I like the way it makes my skin feel and look I will keep using it but I’m still on the hunt for the perfect oily skin moisturizer.",2

Great moisturizer for oily skin",4,I have extremely oily skin and was searching for a moisturizer that wouldn't make me even more greasy. This moisturizer does a great job at controlling the oiliness on my face. I've been using it for a few days so far. It's not perfect and I still have to blot my face periodically during the day. But It cuts the shine dramatically! I can now go for 4-5 hours before needing to blot the oils from my face.  I'm using this product before the NYX Angel Veil face primer and Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear foundation. I'll update this review as I use the product longer.,2

Since I use several anti-aging products on my skin like actives and retinol, I need a moisturizer to use afterwards, and this works. I only use moisturizer at night mainly and during the day, I use a matifying primer before putting on make up. This is the best routine that works for me.

Small size too expensive",4,"I am really enjoying this moisturizer, hasn’t bothered my sensitive skin or acne at all and makes my face silky soft. However I didn’t notice the ounces when I purchased. This is like a sample size. Seems way too expensive for how little you get.",0

Combination skin-okay",4,"Like others, my package arrived with the bottom of the box torn off. I wonder if these are boxes opened by people in stores? Just a gander. This is very light weight and so far it does appear to control the shine. Pore size meh I am not seeing any reduction in appearance but that is probably an impossible ask. I think I need a little more moisture in some areas but this works well for my t-zone",0

Perfect but....",4,"The smell, oh gods the horrible smell! I love this stuff, it's a thick gel that dries matte, but still moisturizes BUT smells like an old lady smell that I just can't deal with. Tried this for a month but just can't bring myself to use anymore because of the awful stench.",0
