Reliable",4,"CeraVe is a skincare brand that offers a range of products such as cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens, and serums. The brand is known for its use of ceramides, which are natural lipids found in the skin that help to maintain the skin's barrier function.Overall, CeraVe products are highly rated by dermatologists and consumers alike due to their effectiveness and affordability. Many of their products are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and suitable for sensitive skin. The brand is also well-known for its moisturizing properties, which can help to improve the appearance of dry or irritated skin.However, as with any skincare brand, some people may experience negative reactions or find that the products don't work well for their specific skin type. It's always recommended to patch test new products and consult with a dermatologist if you have any concerns about your skin.My only concern is pricing I remember buying this product way cheaper in Sam's club",11

Great for combination skin",4,"I have dry skin that becomes oily due to the dryness. I’m really picky about moisturizer because I didn’t want anything that would 1) flake and show my dry skin or 2) make me shinier than I already get! So far this moisturizer has been pretty good at going on matte/non greasy without peeling or making my skin drier. I wish it was less “sticky” upon putting it on my face, as my nighttime non spf moisturizer goes on super smooth and creamy. This one is just much thicker I assume because of the spf in it. Also sometimes I do get very dry skin patches w this moisturizer whereas with my other non spf one I don’t get dry patches. I think this moisturizer doesn’t have as much hydration in it so I have to apply another moisturizer on those spots then it goes away. So not a huge deal. This is the first spf moisturizer I have tried so I can’t compare it to other spf products, but overall it’s a good daily moisturizer and hasn’t caused any breakouts which is awesome since I have very sensitive skin. Overall I would recommend this product especially for the low price!",5

Has Pros and Cons",4,"I liked this sunscreen a lot for my sensitive skin but I didn’t like how it would pill after putting it on top of a product no mater how long I let that product absorb. I also didn’t like the whitecast since I am dark skinned, and I didn’t feel like it was moisturizing my skin enough (I have dry skin). Also be careful getting it near your eyes because it will burn. However, I feel like it is a good value sunscreen that will do its job protection wise.",0

Works great",4,This is a good moisturizer with spf for someone who needs fragrance free. If you have super dry skin then it’s not going to cover those dry spots with one application. I have to exfoliate my face first or use an additional moisturizer in the difficult dry spots. It works great otherwise. Does smell a little like suntan lotion but very light.,5

Has consistency of zinc oxide sunscreen",4,Probably a good choice to combine sunscreen with moisturizer for face when outdoors during summer. But this stuff is very thick and goes on like a heavy zinc oxide sunscreen. It does eventually become transparent but you have to work it in well. Also kind of expensive for the amount you get. Might be better to just use your regular moisturizer and then put your own sunscreen on over it. Definitely cheaper that way.,4

Great, but not as hydrating as I thought",4,"So this moisturizer seems like it will be great for protecting from the sun, but it isn't as hydrating as I had thought it would be especially after cleansing & toning my face. I had to add another moisturizer on top of it to have my face feel like it wasn't super dry. I do have the skin type that dries out easily after washing so that may be part of the issue. And I don't mind adding a bit of a different type of moisturizer on top. I have also used it mid day as a re apply and didn't feel like I needed additional hydration so it is likely just my skin type after washing.It doesn't leave a white cast on my face and it rubs in and absorbs really well in my opinion. I have very light skin so I cannot speak for darker skin tones.All in all I really like this lotion even though it isn't as hydrating after washing.The price is pretty good in comparison to other moisturizers with spf so I will likely continue purchasing this product.",19

good way to protect your skin daily",4,"I truly love cerave products and adore the nighttime version of this moisturizer that I’ve been using for years. I am a person who absolutely hates everything about sunscreen, the texture, smell, rubbing it in, the aftermath feeling of it in my skin, everything. Although this doesn’t solve these problems for me, it drastically helps. Since the spf is in a moisturizer it spreads more easily and doesn’t feel like I’m rubbing chalk into my skin. When it dries I still get the stiff sensation that sunscreen leaves but I’m happy that my face is protected and it isn’t as horrible of a process as it could be. Because of the spf there is a slight slight tiny scent but it is truly unscented unless you are incredibly sensitive. The price is fair for a product of this good quality but I feel like it is a bit much. Perfect for someone who may forget to use sunscreen daily and wants to protect their skin.",12

Feels like sunscreen",4,I was hoping this face lotion was going to feel more like a lotion feeling to me it feels like sunscreen going on. I like the fact that it has 30 in it. It doesn’t make my face dry. It rubs in well. Otherwise I love all of Cervae products. I just wish it was more like a lotion feeling then a sunscreen feeling.,4

Great way to put sunblock on your face!",4,"Putting sunblock on your face almost always feels awful, but this moisturizer makes it not so awful.I have the PM version of this moisturizer, too, and it’s amazing. This AM version adds some sunscreen to kick it up to SPF 30, and it does do without making the whole thing feel heavy and/or thick and/or greasy. It’s still noticeably thicker and heavier than the non-sunscreen version, but only by a little bit.As a huge bonus, it actually works. It does both of its jobs. It prevents sunburn and it keeps my skin moisturized. And by keeping my skin moisturized, it’s actually made my face LESS oily, presumably because it’s better balanced and doesn’t feel the need to always produce oil. Pretty great.I’d give it 5 stars if it felt identical to the PM moisturizer, but I’m also kinda thinking that may not actually be possible. Maybe it is, but this one doesn’t achieve that.",3

Great for oily complexion!",4,"I have combination skin, but my T-zone can get incredibly oily, especially in the summer. This face lotion gives me a matte finish throughout the entire day. Not only does it prevent me from looking or feeling greasy, my make-up stays on much longer! I absolutely hate wearing foundation in the summer, so I mix a small drop of my foundation to the lotion and then apply it onto my face & neck. Essentially, I am making a tinted moisturizer, as I am medium to dark tan. I do feel it can be a bit more moisturizing, but it is still by far my most favorite face lotion.",9

Works well if not used on top of another product...",4,"During the quarantine I have tried to focus a little more on improving my skincare routine which is why I began incorporating sunscreen to my daily routine. I was drawn to this product because its a 2-in-one moisturizer and sunscreen which allowed me to minimize the amount of products I would need to layer on my face.The pros of this product are that it is a reasonable price, is moisturizing on my dry skin, has a reasonable SPF level (SPF 30) and leaves practically no white cast. It also works very well under makeup.The con however, is that this product is a bit tricky to layer. I apply a vitamin C serum to my face before applying this product. When it comes time to apply this product if I don’t act quickly it begins to clump up as I rub it on my face. I do not notice this clumping effect when I use it by itself or if I quickly apply it and don’t give the product any time to dry on my face (clumping starts after about 30 secs of applying it if I go back and add more). This is something to take into consideration if you layer several oils or serums before applying your moisturizer.I would also like to add that I have not noticed any breakouts or skin reactions when using this product. My skin is a bit on the dry side but it is generally not sensitive to products.Overall this product gets a 4/5 because the pros outweigh the cons but that clumping effect is a bit annoying.",3

Exceptional Moisturizer in Every Way",4,"This is without a doubt the best facial moisturizer I've ever used. It's very high quality. A small dab goes a long way and serves to keep skin in wonderful condition. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It was recommended by my dermatologist, and I'm thrilled to have it.4 STARS:  My only negative comment is that the container design is not well made for stability. It just will not stand up. It falls over constantly, and I'm hunting around for it, as a result. I wish there were a larger base to the bottle to anchor it, so that it would sit in an upright position. Please pass this on to your product design experts to see if they might consider a broader base to stabilize the bottle.",25

Great",4,"I was expecting this to have more of a lotion-like consistency since it was advertised as a moisturizer, but it's basically a sunscreen. But overall, I'm very satisfied with the product. As someone with oily skin, I often struggle with finding the right sunscreen, and the cerave AM lotion keeps my face moisturized and provides sun protection, but doesn't make my face too oily. The scent of sunscreen is a bit strong though.",4

A solid choice for everyday use with SPF protection",4,"I've been using CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 for a while now and overall, I am satisfied with the product. The lotion has a lightweight, non-greasy formula that absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated throughout the day. The added SPF 30 is a great feature for daily use, providing a layer of protection against the sun's harmful rays. However, the smell is not my favorite, it has a medicinal scent that might be off-putting for some people. Additionally, the lotion is not as moisturizing as I would have liked, I still need to use a separate night cream. But all in all, it's a solid choice for everyday use with added sun protection.",13

Great product but use cautiously",4,Great product especially if you have acne prone skin. Doesn’t clog pores. It is very moisturizing and it has spf! That’s a plus! My skin is light brown so the only thing I hate is that it has a bit of the white tint sunscreen normally leaves on brown skin. It’s not as bad as normal sunscreen but I feel like I can tell. It smells pretty good (not highly scented but not medicinal). You only need about two pumps for your whole face.,22
