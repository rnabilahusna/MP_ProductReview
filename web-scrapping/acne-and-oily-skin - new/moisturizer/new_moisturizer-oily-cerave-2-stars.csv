Not worth the effort",2,"Pros: The product did not irritate my skin at all. I like that there‚Äôs sunscreen in it.Cons: At least for me, it took forever to rub into my skin completely, and I felt like I had to use a decent bit of it in order to leave my skin feeling moisturized. It just wasn‚Äôt worth the effort for me when I think there are better products out there.",0

Read The Ingredients! Make Sure You‚Äôre Not Allergic!",2,"I bought this because I was looking for a proper facial moisturizer, CeraVe is of course well known and this one specifically has spf30 so it seemed like a good option. Seemed okay at first but while i rubbed it in my skin it was.. clumping up? which i could tolerate as long as it did its job. later in the day after getting home I noticed my face was red which was strange but i ignored it. I put it on the next day and my face not only turned red but my face also burned, as well as a rash on my neck. Last time I checked I‚Äôm not allergic to anything, I‚Äôve never had issues with trying new products before.",0

Pills",2,I love most CeraVe products but unfortunately the AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with  sunscreen does not absorb like it should.  It pills when makeup is applied.

It leaves a horrible white cast, and if it gets around your eyebrows they will stay white. It is difficult to spread around your face, and gets flaky. Feels like it just stays on your face, and for those with oily skin will just make you look oily with a horrible white cast. Avoid if possible.",3

Goes on super dry and white....",2,"UPDATE:  another star removed. I find that it leaves a peeling of white ‚Äústuff‚Äù on my face. Throwing it away.I had been using an Aveeno brand for years and they recently stopped making it...their new product has soy which I prefer not to use ever in or on my body.  I love the cerave night moisturizing cream so I thought this was going to be a win win but I really don't like it.  It goes on very white and very dry.  I would never call this a combined moisturizer/spf.  To me it does not moisturize at all.  I wore it last weekend and I did burn but to be honest I was out watching a softball game for about five hours so I expect it was just too long under my makeup to perform.  Overall, I will not buy this product again and I am back to purchase something different.",3

Not for Sensitive Skin",2,"Have sensitive skin?If you've experienced general sensitivity (or more) to skincare products in the past, please pay attention to the warnings from other reviewers. I overlooked them initially because my skin is normally only sensitive to more abrasive products. Plus, I'd had luck with other CeraVe products and thought this would be no different‚ÄîI was very wrong.  Within 1 hour of applying this lotion, my whole face turned red and started to break out. I washed it off immediately, but my skin discomfort continued well until the next morning.Have no skin sensitivities?Ignoring my own skin issues, I also wanted to provide some details on the product itself:1. Even though this is advertised primarily a daily moisturizer, it is still a sunscreen at its core. This means it still has the distinct smell you'd expect from a standard sunscreen (and has a similar weight too).2. With its thick consistency, this likely wouldn't be the best option for someone who plans on wearing foundation over it everyday. Or, if you do, you may want to apply it sparingly knowing that your sun coverage may be lighter.Keeping all of this in mind, if you are not sensitive to the smell of sunscreen and do not regularly use makeup, then this product may be a great fit for you. I just recommend thinking through what you're looking for in daily moisturizer like this first before deciding if it's the right chioce.",3

Sensitive and acne prone skin people beware",2,"Prior to purchasing the CeraVe Am facial moisturizer with SPF30, I was using a Cetaphil Moisturizer with SPF 50. However, as I was nearing the end of my Cetaphil moisturizer, I began to get more oily and figured I try a different moisturizer.  I have also been dealing with Maskne as I‚Äôm not allowed to wear a clothe mask at the hospital I‚Äôm currently working at, even more reason why I wanted something with acne ridding ingredients.  Because of that I figured I‚Äôd give the CeraVe AM moisturizer a try especially because of the active ingredients it has (I.e. niacinamide  & hyaluronic acid ) as well as the positive reviews it has received on TikTok and here on Amazon. Unfortunately, within the first day my face began to feel itchy, scabby, tingly and I developed a rash all over my face. Prior to this I had been using the Paula‚Äôs Choice liquid exfoliate and my skin was smooth except for the areas with maskne. While I understand that everyone‚Äôs skin will respond differently, I‚Äôm still left with a rash and uncomfortable feeling all over my face. Also, I decided to give a 2 start rating as it began to peel when I tried to massage the moisturizer into my skin. Some positives are that this is more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer, which was what  I was looking for. Also, it has no scent which is typically preferred by people with sensitive skin. I will end with the cautionary note to make sure you patch test first!! It‚Äôs been 3 days and the rash hasn‚Äôt resided.",9

Leaves a white cast",2,"Pros‚Äì Moisturizes really well.‚Äì Protects from UVB radiation.‚Äì Doesn't smell.‚Äì Comes with a pump.Cons‚Äì Leaves a white cast.‚Äì Pills.‚Äì Makes my face look sweaty when I'm hot.ReviewI'm finishing my second bottle of this moisturizer, and I really wanted to like it. I like the price and the fact that it's supposed to hydrate and protect your skin from sun damage all in one product, no separate sunscreen needed. And sure, it does hydrate really well: my skin felt silky smooth, and I even got complimented on how supple it was. The moisturizer also doesn't smell ‚Äì all the more reasons to like it.But, unfortunately, I couldn't. First of all, it leaves a white cast that is noticeable even on my very pale skin. I also noticed that it tends to pill. The moisturizer absorbs quickly after I apply it, but if I rub it a touch too much to spread more evenly, the sunscreen would ball up and leave patches of white residue on my face. Before applying this moisturizer, I just wash my face with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, yet it still manages to pill. I haven't tried, but I also can't imagine what would happen if I used more products before it.It also tends to make my face look excessively sweaty when I'm hot. It feels like sweat forms on my face and doesn't go away. It just stays in place, unless I wipe it. This doesn't happen if I don't wear this moisturizer and if I'm not really hot. To illustrate how bad it is, I ran to a friend's place in the winter and got a bit hot. When I came back from washing my hands, my friend asked me if I'd washed my face too. I didn't.I am also concerned about how well it protects from UVA spectrum radiation. It is supposed to offer broad-spectrum protection, yet the manufacturer doesn't specify the UVA-related ratings, such as PA or PPD, which is expected in the US, but doesn't inform me.",8

Not for men- highly visible flecks in a little bit of stubble",2,"I really don't like this product. It leaves a white cast, always bleeds into my eyes, and won't rub in if it touches my facial hair. It also has both chemical and physical sunblock- so you get the downsides of both. White cast from the physical, and strong sunscreen scent from the chemical. It also is not very moisturizing.I would recommend either using something higher end, or using a separate moisturizer and sunblock.On the plus side, it does block the sun very well and has never caused my acne-prone skin to break out.Difficult to capture in a photo, but I did my best.",5

Blegh. Another greasy, impossible to rub in sunscreen",2,"I love CeraVe so I was blown away with how poorly this applies and just works in general.

balls up",2,"other reviews mentioning this stuff pills were right. you try to rub in this stuff and it will rub off before it even soaks in all the way in some places. Why? Idk... maybe using juuust too much blocks more from absorbing and then it just rubs off. It reminds me of working with clay when it is getting leather hard, you think it is moist enough but when you smooth it it just skids from uneven drying/moisture being sucked into or out of your own fingers/hands. I put this on after I cleanse, tone, and use serum too so its not oils or dead skin buildup or something. Maybe if you used this right away after using toner or equivalent like micellar water without using any serum it might not pill. It is a shame because this stuff doesn't set off my greasy texture aversions that I usually hate in sunscreen, it does feel pretty matte.",0

Meh. Doesn‚Äôt absorb into my skin for some reason.",2,"The seller was great but the product was crap, despite hearing a lot of great things. I have very dry skin in the winter and I thought this was going to do the trick. For starters, it doesn‚Äôt fully absorb into my skin. And because it‚Äôs white in color it makes my face white too. The longer I rub it in, the stickier it feels. My face feels absolutely tacky and sticky. I just don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôve never seen anything like that before in a moisturizer. I thought ok maybe I have a weird face. I‚Äôll use it elsewhere on my body for moisturizer. Nope. It just doesn‚Äôt absorb into my skin on any part of my body.

My entire facial area was beet red and warm to the touch. After carefully cleansing with Cetaphil cleanser and patting dry, I applied vaseline and was taking a Benadryl every 6 hours for 2 days. Slowly the swelling and redness went down but the the affected areas where the rash had appeared began to peel...What an experience.

It also contains Zinc oxide (which I don‚Äôt mind bc a mineral sunscreen is the best barrier to the sun) and this not only leaves a slight white cast put also leaves a weird residue such that your face will bead up with the product after you apply it (it will look and feel dirty). It‚Äôs impossible to wear makeup over this without the ‚Äúmoisturizer‚Äù pilling and looking dirty underneath.Good to use if you want to sub it out for your facial sunscreen- real-time Does a good job of protecting against sun damage- but this shouldn‚Äôt be called a moisturizer.",0

Not for everyone",2,"Okay... so here‚Äôs the thing with this product, it is good, it has quite good ingredients and it feels good on the skin however it leaves a terrible white cast and, as a person with a deeper skin tone, the product doesn‚Äôt really fit me. It is CeraVe and it has its quality but for people with deeper skin tones is a no no. Also try to avoid the eyes area because it makes your eyes teary and itches quite a lot (I experienced it in first hand).Also it is way smaller than what I was expecting and let me give you an advice: this is a ‚ÄúTwo in one‚Äù product; as it is a moisturizer AND a sunscreen it means that in order to get the SPF that the packaging of the product is claiming you need to use quite a lot of the product because the sunscreen properties are diluted in the moisturizer and as it is this small you‚Äôll find yourself finishing the small little bottle in no time; so that‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you buy a sunscreen that has moisturizer in it.In my very personal opinion, you should go for a product that is moisturizer entirely as well as the sunscreen, don‚Äôt play games with sunscreen, it is one, if not the most important step on a skin care routine.",8

I needed antibiotics to clear up the infection on my eyelid.  I don't know for certain that the moisturizer caused the stye,  but I had never gotten one before so I suspect it was the cause.

White flakes all over your face",2,So normally I use the CeraVe cream on my face but felt like I should start using something with sunscreen to help protect my skin and prevent aging. This lotion is the worst. I really hope it's a knockoff and not the actual CeraVe because it's so bad. I use only one pump and it makes white flakes while you're working it into your skin and then just flakes off all day. I thought that maybe there might be too much zinc oxide powder in my batch so I tried thinning it out with some of the cream but it still is happening. Even with actual sunscreen my face is never covered in white flakes like this. Buy something else because this will just make you look like a flaky ghost.,0

More Sunscreen than Moisturizer, Thick Without Penetrating",2,"I normally love Cerave, especially their PM moisturizer, but this was a disappointment. The product leaves a heavy white cast that takes as long as body sunscreen to massage in. Also, I often combine moisturizers with other products, either mixing them 1:1 or applying them in rapid succession. This lotion is the only one I've tried that reacted poorly with even non-exfoliating serums, leaving small, rolled, white clumps that looked like dead skin. A few other reviewers posted pictures nailing it.It then leaves a dewy finish, but you can feel that's it's surface level moisture. When I wash it off with a gentle cleanser at the end of the day, my skin feels dehydrated as if I hadn't been using a moisturizer at all.The best I can say is that it arrived as described, with a full and undamaged bottle. It also didn't break me out, and I haven't gotten even a touch of sunburn with it on. But Cerave's ""Ultra Light"" alternative is twice as good and worth the price difference.",2

I expected big things based on reviews but‚Ä¶",2,"The reviews for this product spoke so highly of it that I expected really great things. Unfortunately it fell far short for me. It does not soak into the skin unless I massage it in for a long time, far longer than I‚Äôve ever had to do for literally any other moisturizer I‚Äôve ever had. My skin feels somewhat moisturized for a half hour, but feels like it dries out faster than ever after using this product. On top of that, ever since I started using it, my two dry patches on my cheeks have gotten worse than ever and I‚Äôve broken out far more frequently along my jawline. So glad it works for others, but it‚Äôs not a great fit for everyone unfortunately.",0

So disappointing!!!",2,"This moisturizer is such a let down because the ingredients it lists are some of my favorite (hyaluronic acid, niacinamide), the texture of it is nice and non greasy, and it doesn‚Äôt make my face look oily like most SPF moisturizers do. It actually looks really nice on the spots where I manage to rub it in all the way - that‚Äôs where the caveat lies. This moisturizer is a nightmare when it comes to pulling and flaking off. It literally looks like I rubbed wet toilet paper all over my face with the amount of weird little white flakes and clumps that are all over my face. I have tried to use this moisturizer all types of ways to see if it was just user error - I have tried with and without other products underneath, I have tried rubbing and patting it in. Nothing stops the pilling and flaking from happening. I can‚Äôt even imagine how gross it would be if I tried to put makeup over this. I‚Äôm very disappointed and definitely returning this because I can‚Äôt use it if it‚Äôs going to make my face look like this.",17

I was very disappointed with the formula, it went on pasty and was almost chunky, although it did dry down. If I touch my face after it has dried down it easily rolls off, even when I put it on bare dry skin with no other skincare products. Spot concealing on top results in sunscreen/moisturizer residue collecting on my beauty blender which hasn't happened with other spf moisturizers before.
