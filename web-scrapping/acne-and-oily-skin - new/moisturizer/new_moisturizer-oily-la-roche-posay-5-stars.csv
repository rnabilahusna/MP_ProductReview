This is unparalleled perfection",5,"**************************PRO TIP****************************I took the advice of another reviewer and cut off the bottom of the tube to see if I could get any more out, and sure enough, there was a treasure trove of extra moisturizer at the top near the opening that will last you another week at the minimum. When you reach the end of your bottle, definitely cut it open, because this stuff is expensive. I was able to carefully wrap the tube up and store it in a plastic baggie with all the air squeezed out. In total, this tiny bottle lasted from the beginning of August until mid-October for me.********************************************************Review:Previously, I've never in my 23 years of life ever been able to have clear skin (other than before puberty). I've always had acne. I always took great care of my face (washed twice a day, avoided touching it), but nothing ever worked. All of the other things on the market (even the supposed #1 dermatologist recommended) never did anything for me; none of the dermatological-prescribed creams, pills, or face washes could ever touch me. I have combination skin: oily/greasy city in some places, and dry as the Sahara in others. If you have it too, you have my sincere condolences, because I think that up to this point in my review, we have had the same experience.Until this brand. Unlike other moisturizers, it's not heavy. It doesn't feel like it's cake. It's light and my skin breathes. It moisturizes the dry spots and doesn't irritate or inflame the acne-prone oily spots. I live in Texas - AKA sweaty city - and I swear, this stuff still doesn't feel like it's heavy on my face, even when it's 105 out. I've never moisturized before because of my acne and my stupid combination skin, but after buying this, I can see that it's possible. You get what you pay for with this stuff.Now, price-wise, it is a little much. And the bottle is laughably small. But like other reviewers mentioned, a little bit really goes a long way. I do a tiny pea-sized dab for each cheek (which you can push to cover your nose and chin/upper lip) and another for my forehead and that's worked well for me. It spreads very, very easily. The smell doesn't bother me; other reviews mentioned a chemical smell, but I wouldn't really put it like that. It just smells like cream.I wish I'd had this stuff at 14. Maybe my life would've been different. Do yourself a favor and buy this. You will not be sorry.**edit**I wanted to come and edit this review to specifically mention the importance of using this moisturizer in combination with the face wash. The face wash I bought along with this is La Rochay Effaclar Purifying Gel. I am always so instinctively skeptical and wary about using anything that claims to ""moisturize"" my face, so after about 2 months I stopped applying this moisturizer after every wash and started only doing it a few times a week - bad, bad, BAD idea. My face in turn began producing oils to compensate for the drying effects of my face wash. After all, the face wash is more on the acidic side. After trial and error, I'm here to tell you that yes, you need to use this stuff every time you wash your face. It doesn't make me break out whatsoever unless I skip one of these two products. Do not skip this important step! Face wash alone is not enough to keep your face clear (if you have combo skin like me).",140

Fantastic Moisture for Oily Skin.  Controls Oil for Hours.",5,"Even in middle-age, my skin is still as oily as a teenager's.  While that may be great for keeping the wrinkles at bay, no one likes the shiny-faced look and the problems that go with it in putting on makeup.  After using a few other La Roche-Posay facial products, I gave this one a try and it's fabulous!  It looks a little ""frosted"" coming out of the tube...a little matte...not shiny like other moisturizers.  It goes on smoothly, is lightweight, and give a matte finish to your face IMMEDIATELY.  Does a good job of making your skin feel soft and smooth with no shine involved.  If you wanted to go out without makeup, you could very easily, and now I often do.  I simply couldn't do that before.  I always felt that I had to put on some powder to take away the shine from a moisturizer...but now there IS no shine to have to cover up.  Amazing.When I do apply makeup, there's no residue or oil that gets added to the mix.  Foundations go on beautifully without reacting with greasy moisturizer.  And like the other products in this line, it has been wonderful on my very sensitive and allergic skin...no breakouts and overall redness seems to be reduced.  I just love this stuff.One day, my teen daughter asked to use some.  She loves it and is now lobbying for her own supply.  I wish this had been around when I was a teen!  Highly recommend.  Pricey, but a little goes a long way, and you may save on all the makeup.  :)",18

The BEST!",5,"I LOVE this moisturizer! I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it before! I've been using this product for years now and I'll never stop as long as they make it! This moisturizer is great for combination or oily skin. I use it every day after showering and washing my face. I have bad combination skin. My skin is extremely irritable. I break out and get rashes from almost everything, but not this! I have persistent adult acne and rashes. My skin also gets very dry and cracked, especially in the winter. Before using this product I'd get painful and embarrassing cracking and redness around my nose and mouth every winter and I haven't had it since! My skin can get painfully dry on top of having acne.If you frequently have to wash your face, or any skin, because of acne or irritation that can dry out your skin and your body can try to overcompensate for that dryness and produce more oil than needed, microscopic cracks can form in the skin and get irritated by this oil or dirt and clog pores and guess what? You're back where you started. This ends the cycle of combination skin!My face looks and feels smoother after every use! It visibly reduces pores and redness without making skin only. It's soothing and very effective. I'd recommend this product for everyone, not just those with sensitive or problem skin.It feels light on the skin and leaves you feeling fresh and perfectly moisturized all day. The matte finish won't over dry skin but also prevents break outs, and feels like you have nothing on, not oily at all!Its so unnoticeable I honestly don't realize how effective it is until I run out again and my skin starts feeling dry and breaking out.",6

I start my morning face routine at  6:30am, and usually have to start blotting at 10 am. Horrible I know!!  Since using this product I only had to blot once at around 2-3pm. This is my holy grail.

Instant Mattifying and Shrink Pores on Oily Skin",5,"I got this for oily-shiny skin with large pores. Used to use Toreriane Double-Repair ($19.99 on Amazon) and it worked well until the change in the weather. Humid and hot summer made skin more prone to breakout and caused an easy breakout. So I switched to this one recently and noticed the instant effect on my skin. My pores looked nothing like before, and there was no shine spot on my face. It did look very clean and felt clean too. It is more expensive, but it is worth using for the summer/humid season, and I don't have to buy other expensive acne creams anymore. I also use the facewash gel from the same skincare line, and the first bottle lasted about five months, am&pm use. I will go back to Toreriane once the weather gets cooler and dry.",12

Day 2 of using it",5,"At the end of Day #2 that i’ve been using this product, I touch my face with a forefinger. Lo and behold, my finger came out non-greasy. In disbelief, I rub a finger again all over my face. I check and still no oil residue. I finally found a part of my face that’s still oily, and that is my forehead.For someone that has an oily skin since puberty, this is the first time that my finger left my face without grease. Perhaps, the day is colder than usual, hence, the less facial grease. But idk, I am compelled to write a positive review for this product. I’ve been an Amazon prime customer since the beginning of time and have not written any review until now.My face is sooo non-oily that i’m now concern that my face will be very dry, non-supple and may prematurely age.",2

The best moisturizer I've ever used for my oily skin",5,"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used!  I have extremely oily and acne prone skin.  Even using ""oil free"" moisturizers pose a problem for me.  I was hesitant to purchase this moisturizer due to the small quantity and high price. I'm a frugal individual and don't like to pay a lot for my beauty products.  However, I was desperate to find something because I was tired of having an oily sheen on my skin just a couple of hours after applying my makeup.  After a lot of research and reading reviews I decided to take a chance on La Roche Posay Effaclar Mat moisturizer.  This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used.  Don't be put off by how little you get.  Honestly, you only need a small pea sized amount for your entire face.  Remember, this is a mattifying moisturizer.  This is meant for oily skin to just keep your skin hydrated and healthy while keeping oil at bay.  Even after application my skin still feels dry but hydrated.  This is a must if you have oily skin like me.  If you have normal to dry skin this likely is not for you.  I've used this moisturizer for a couple months now and even using it alone without make up I notice a difference in oil build up - there really isn't any!!! I've been using this in conjunction with BECCA Ever Matte Poreless Priming Perfector and I'm so pleased with the results.  I do have to blot my skin about mid day but that is a dramatic decrease from having to blot at least 4 times a day with my previous regimen. Well worth the money and I will definitely be a repeat customer.",124

Love this product",5,"I struggle with very oily skin. My makeup always slides off in hours. Adding this moisturizer to my routine was a game changer. I use this product first, then use the Urban decay All-nighter setting spray, La Roche Boday mattifying primer, Loreal Infallible 24 hour powder foundation, then more setting spray.My makeup stays on, maybe one touch up with powder during the day, and minimal transfer to my mask. I wear a mask 8 hours at a time at work.  I have been doing this 6 weeks and no break outs. I have never been happier with my routine.My only criticism is I wish this moisturizer had SPF. I’m always hesitant to add that in with another moisturizer and become too oily.",9

Nice “matted” moisturizer.",5,"I used to use MAC “Matte” to eliminate the shine on my face, forehead and ears, but they stopped making it for some reason. The next best thing is “Invisamatte” from Fenty Beauty which is basically a pat on or brush on powder, kind of like theatrical makeup.This is the best moisturizer I have used on my skin so far. It’s not oily and as it dries it leaves a matted finish. The scent is light, nice and not overbearing, this is a really good product with good ingredients. While  it doesn’t Matte down as much as the Mac product did it still reduces the shiny skin look while moisturizing your skin at the same time.",6

This is the best moisturizer I have EVER used in my life - which sucks just a bit, because she IS expensive. I've yet to find a suitable dupe, and after close to a year or so of trying and continuously being impressed by this every time I put it on my face, I've stopped trying to cut corners and just accepted this as my skincare savior.My fingers glide over my skin so easily after using this moisturizer; it gets rid of my oily t-zone issues, and seems to moisturize all my dry spots DEEPLY with just a pea sized amount for my entire face.

I have large pores in my T zone and around the nose, always struggling with sebum (oil) in that zone and have super dry skin on my cheeks, so, I was looking for the cream which can regulate the sebum and moisturize the cheeks skin. And I found one! Finally, after trying dozens of different creams - this is the PERFECT one for me!!! My pores reduced in size after just a few days of usage. Finally! I was struggling with it so much! The general color of my face changed, got rid of dark circles, brown-ish shade on the face, as you can see on pics - my skin looks much healthier and fresh. All the picS were taken wearing zero make up for my own track. Omg, it’s just like a magic emulsion for my skin. Definitely recommend to try if you have the same problems as I do.",145

LOVE THIS PRODUCT!",5,"I have dealt with oily skin ever since I can remember and this lotion has helped tremendously. There are hundreds of facial lotions out there for oily skin, but I ultimately decided to try this one due to its high reviews across a variety of websites and channels. In the end, I would say that it has decreased the shine and oil on my face by about 60%-70%, reduced the appendence of my pores, leaves a nice mat finish, and it absorbs extremely well. I do still have to blot my skin once a day, but that is a huge improvement from when I would do it 3-5 times a day. It also gets along well with my super sensitive skin, which is something I am always worried about.I was surprised at how small the bottle was for the price, but a little does go a long way and I only use it once a day so I believe it will last me for a while. This lotion also does not moisturize much at all, but I have been able to balance that out by using a heavier night cream.",3

Works For hormonal Cystic acne",5,"I have horrible hormonal cystic acne on my face and upper back and sometimes even my legs, when I am in my first trimester of pregnancy. I have been using Yesto tomatoes acne wash, toner and charcoal masks (the later of which is my fav) and I just now started tea tree oil directly on the outbreaks (doesn't dry but clears out the redness within 1-2 days) and I now use this moisturizer (also works as a primer for mineral makeup) and have had zero complications from it.  I know right away if a moisturizer won't work: clogged, greasy, outbreaks... This one has none of that. When I'm not pregnant I use pantothenic acid supplements, around 4000 mg a day for 3 days a month. Now pregnant I don't know if that is safe so I will be avoiding that. I do know that pantothenic acid is okay in small amounts as it is in my raw prenatal (8mg).",2

Great for combination oily/dry, acne-prone, porous skin. Purchase SPF separately.",5,"This moisturizer is perfect for my combination oily + dry skin (i.e. my skin is oily on the forehead, chin and between the brows; dry at the edges of my nose and jawbone). I used to go through 2-3 packages of blotting paper per month, and now I only have to blot my chin and forehead *maybe* once a day (if it's hot out).My skin is also acne-prone, but I didn't have any problems in that regard while using this moisturizer—on the contrary.It really does blur the appearance of large pores. (I combine it with Maybelline's Baby Skin primer [pore-reducer] product, and they work great together).*Only downside*: There's no SPF in the moisturizer, so I'd recommend buying La Roche Posay's Anthelios (oil-free) SPF 60 separately, and layering it on top. The two work great together, and, again, don't make my face oily or break out. I'd definitely buy both again.",6

SILKY SMOOTH SKIN",5,5/5 ALL THE WAY! I have acne-prone VERY oily skin! When i first applied this. It wasn't sticky at all and takes about 1-2 min to completely absorb into my skin! But once it dries down. It is MATTE! Believe me when i say this is GREAT. I have tried over 10 different moisturizer from drugstore to 60 dollars ones and all seems to be too sticky or leave my skin very oily! This is a miracle! Although i wish i would get more products because I can imagine I'd be running out of this in just 1 month. If you have oily skin and is acne prone. This is going a MIRACLE WORKER for you. This is my 1st week of using this moisturizer and it has not broken me out yet which is another plus! TOTALLY RECOMMEND to any of my oily skin gals out there!,168

BEST MOISTURIZER TO EVEN OUT SKIN",5,"Wow. I got this in the mail about a week ago and have been using it every day...the little bumps on the face and forehead are gone, my sensitive (both dry and oily) skin loves the way it feels and there's no smell which is a plus. I would recommend this product to anyone who is just starting to be interested in skin care or has been obsessed with it for years because it's such a simple, but important part of skincare!",2

Eliminates about 70% of shine in my oily skin, very effective, but high cost.",5,"I have extra-oily facial skin and a lot of shine. I have to wash my face in restaurant bathrooms (and social events) all the time.This mattifing lotion is very expensive, but just a little bit eliminates about 70% of shine, which for me, is amazing,. The shin seems much more matte and not as shiny and I get moisture too. In about 4 hours in social event (nighttime, cool temperature), I washed my face just to eliminate any shine that was beginning to show up, but even then, I was still much less shiny then normal. :) But this does the job, no doubt! :)The cons are high cost and made in France (NOT made in USA). :-/But works, so I cough up the cash for it. :)",2

I use it twice a day (morning & night) and it works great under my makeup",5,"I have really sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and this lotion was exactly what I was looking for! I needed something for everyday use, that would not make me break out. I have been using this product now for about a month and have noticed that it has helped my skin actually. I use it twice a day (morning & night) and it works great under my makeup. When I first saw the size of the product for the price, I was a little annoyed, but it has lasted me a lot longer than I initially expected. You only need a small amount for your whole face. It doesn't burn my eyes like lotions I've tried in the past and it doesn't feel heavy at all. I really really like this face lotion! If you are thinking of trying it, it is worth a try!",0

Skin feels great, matte, and hydrated",5,"I have oily skin so I specifically searched for ""moisturizers for oily skin"" and was excited to see La Roche-Posay had a product to fit my exact needs. I already use 
La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel Cleanser for Oily Skin
 with great results so I trust the brand. This moisturizer is great on many levels: I do feel like my skin is hydrated after use, it definitely does make my skin matte throughout most of the day (at least until I get back after 8 hours of work), and a little bit of the product does go a long way. I am a little scared the bottle won't last me long, even if I don't need much of the lotion per use, but I'm happy with how it's working so far and might get another one later this year anyways.",0

The best stuff in the smallest bottle",5,"Wow this stuff has been fantastic. My face is so clear and matte looking, I've literally never in my life had skin this clear. I know for a fact this stuff works because I ran out and didn't buy another bottle right away and sure enough my face broke out after a week. My biggest complaint is the bottle size being so damn small, so I've worked around this by combining usage with their double repair moisturizer. I do the matte in the morning and the double repair at night. I've found it to be a great combo.",0

If you have concerns about pores/skin texture and oily skin, THIS IS THE BOMB. It's mattifying so I wouldn't recommend it if you want a glow, but my pores and texture were visibly minimized. It corrects and it's moisturizing. LOVED IT and will purchase again.",0

A little goes a long way",5,This is a great all around daily moisturizer and pore reducer.  Two small droplets smoothed into the skin after a wash with a non irritating cleanser lasts a good month or more.  Leaves skin less oily and reduces the size of enlarged pores.  Acne prone skin at any age happens.  A great regimen helps reduce flareups.  This is leave on matte moisturizer is the core paired with a purifying foam cleanser.  A little goes a long way towards clearer skin.  The matte itself is completely invisible.  Leaves your skin more even regardless if oily or dry.  Great product.,0

So expensive, but I haven't found anything else that works as well as this does.",5,For about a month I tried various face moisturizers and they would all make my face feel and look super oily immediately or by mid day. That or they would make my face break out.This however I can wear all day without my face getting greasy and it absorbs super fast! And my face is not dry by the end of the day either. Works perfectly!Unfortunately it is wayy too expensive! I will continue looking for an alternative because this bottle is literally the size of the palm of my hand at 1.35 oz.,0

Great moisturizer for men too",5,"As a man, the ""works great under makeup"" was a strong selling point in my decision to originally start using this moisturizer a couple of years ago (I jest).  In all seriousness, I use this moisturizer daily on my face after shaving.  I have really weird combination skin that gets super oily in some places, but stays dry in others.  This moisturizer does a really good job of evening that out throughout the day, and limiting the look I otherwise sometimes get that's sort of like ""HELLO MY FOREHEAD IS VERY SHINY HOW ARE YOU TODAY?"".On the days I wear sunscreen (which isn't every day) I never have any problems putting this on first, then putting sunscreen on top.",3

This is the ONLY product that has ever helped me control (and clear up!) acne issues and i highly recommend it especially for people with oily skin!
