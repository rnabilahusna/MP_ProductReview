I like it but very SMALL tube.",3,This product is OVERLY priced. I cannotafford another one so I used it sparingly.I see a difference -pores on face are diminish. It gives somewhat of a clear layer on skin that BLURS pours a little and little imperfections.,0

Not fragrance free!",3,I was so excited to try this product. The feel and look of it when you apply is fabulous. When I put it on I immediately smelled perfume and then my skin started to heat up and turn red. Why on earth would LRP add fragrance to a product targeted for sensitive skin? That makes no sense at all. I think this would be an ideal moisturizer if they removed the perfume. If you actually skin that err‚Äôs on the side of being a little sensitive this really isn‚Äôt the product for you. I‚Äôm sad to send mine back and hope LRP will re-release this fragrance-free!,3

Does what it says but doesn‚Äôt work well with others",3,"I like the lotion itself but it should be the last thing in your routine. I‚Äôve tried layering it with sunscreen and makeup and it starts pilling. The times when I want to wear this lotion are during the day, which need other layers of spf and makeup as well. I like this brand but I wish this had spf in it!",4

Disappointed, caused irritation when used as directed",3,"TLDR: Caused terrible irritation, using sparingly with better luck. Not for sensitive skin. I wanted to love this, I bought it with the gel cleanser to deal with constant stress/skin touching/picking related acne. I used the combo as directed and within a few days my skin was too painful to touch and was worse then ever.I stopped it immediately, this is not a product that should cause purging.I have started it again with a gentle cleanser and sparing use of this moisturizer at night. It is a much better experience, no irritation.",2

Overpriced and bad for the environment",3,"I like this product, and love the Effaclar line, but this moisturizer is priced WAY too high for a daily use. There are other products of similar quality and similar brand name recognition that are far less expensive and have more product in the package. This is WASTEFUL packaging. If they want to sell it for this price per ounce than fine, but at least double the size of your tubes and sell it for a higher price for more. Too much plastic waste. Disappointed by La Roche-Posay and L‚ÄôOr√©al. They should do better to protect our Earth. Consider their global impact and all brands they own. This is by far one of the most wasteful products in terms of package size.  This is like a travel size for airplanes. Or like a sample size they should give you to try at a fancy beauty store. Nobody needs to buy high end face moisturizer in such small quantities. I will continue to use the other La Roche-Posay Effaclar products for now, but I will no longer be purchasing the moisturizer. Also, it annoys me that a company can sell ‚Äúmattifying‚Äù moisturizer. It‚Äôs moisturizer. Your face isn‚Äôt going to look matte. Put on make up.",6

Yes, it peels",3,"I don't know why, but it peels and you can see it, especially if you follow it with sunscreen (I use elta) and compound powder. It's embarrassing because even your eyelashes will catch those white flakes. I have brown skin, so you can imagine how obvious the peels are. I like how moisturizing it is, it keeps my face oil-free for a reasonable amount of time, and my face doesn't break out. But I won't buy again considering how pricey it is.I don't recommend it.",7

Very small bottle / Requires too much to moisturize / Doesn't reduce shiny face much.",3,"Seems like a good lotion (no scent, doesn't seem to cause acne), but the container is tiny for the high cost and I don't notice much reduction in my face becoming shiny and oily despite the ""mat / non shiny"" claim.  I also find that in order to moisturize my dry face I have to use a decent amount of this moisturizer. At this rate the bottle lasts only around a week. There's no way I can afford to purchase another one of these every week.To make it last further I've had to resort to mixing the lotion with some hemp oil I was using prior. Though the entire reason for buying the moisturizer was because of it's claim to reduce shiny face and I wanted to make sure I was using a product that wasn't aggravating my acne. Not sure what to do.",5

a bit too ""creamy"" for my taste",3,"Not bad, not bad. I bought this item from an amazon retailer just over 3 weeks ago. I like the moisturizer because is not super oily creamy like most moisturizers, even those that claim oil free, but it still feels a little heavier than other oil-free gel moisturizers.I've been using this moisturizer as a trio with other La Roche products but I still need to use MK mattyfying spray and translucent powder to obtain that matte effect with my makeup. I don't like to feel my face dry as a paper and flaky, but I've never liked the *glow* effect either.I know that skin tends to overproduce oil when it's very dry to compensate so I apply the moisturizer sparingly on the areas that are drier and very little on the oiler areas but I still try to cover my whole face. Will continue using it and update my review in a few weeks.",0

Don't recommend for sensitive skin",3,"I have dry acne-prone skin. This moisturizer didn't cause any breakouts, yet was quite moisturizing. It also mattifies skin as promised.  But it's quite irritating around eyes. My eyes sting and watered a lot after application. It's not for people with sensitive eyes. Also, I realized after buying it that it's not fragrance-free. Products with fragrance are not recommended for sensitive skin. Won't buy again.",2

It definitely helps with my oily face but I think it made my breakout worse once it had started... so it wasn't worth it.

I still get oily after a couple of hours of use, maybe my face is too oily, I don't know or maybe I haven't been using for long enough, it's been just a month. I like that with only one drop it runs easily over your skin which makes it last longer. I'll wait and see if I get different results over time",0

It did help with the oiliness of my skin a bit, but the redness made it a no go for me. Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive.",4
