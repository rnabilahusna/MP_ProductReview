Good product but can use some work",3,"I use this product because I like that I can get my daily SPF in with my moisturizer. I think it leaves a nice glow BUT ONLY IF YOU DON’T USE TOO MUCH. If you use too much, it will start to pill the way sunscreen does.It has a sunscreen scent to it. I personally like that, but I know not everyone does. I think it’s very simple and it does not break out. It’s also non- comedogenic.My issues with it are 1. It pills the way sunscreen does. 2. The pump broke which I feel like it’s pretty common with products from this brand because it’s not the first time I’ve had it like this happen.",5

Clumps!",3,"For those of you who experience product caking or pilling like me (when using the product in reasonable amounts, as directed), I would honestly try to find a different product. I am in love with CeraVe products and was hoping that this sunscreen would be one that could layer (with lighter moisturizers) while spreading easily and not caking, but it is not. Alone, it does not offer me enough moisture. I cannot spread the product adequately on my face without using another, sheerer moisturizer with it (for example, a hyaluronic acid moisturizer base).Alone, it does not spread well and does not provide adequate moisture. In combination with a sheer moisturizer, it pills or cakes throughout the day, leaving white crumbs on the face. It also leaves a faint white cast on my skin (for reference, I have medium brown skin).I, unfortunately, cannot continue using this product. I could not even use half of the bottle.If you experience similar problems, pass on this product. If you have no idea what I am talking about, you probably will not have issues with this product.",4

Dries my skin out",3,"My face has never been so flakey/dry. I started using this during the winter though and i am five months pregnant, so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. My acne has cleared up though, first time through pregnancy. It also burns. Even around my eyes, and I avoid that area, it’s weird. I don’t know if this is a good thing or bad but I’m going to stop using it because it’s not really helping my face stay moisturized during the winter.",0

I like it...BUT",3,I like how this product feels on my skin. No harsh smell and it isn't sticky. My only gripe is at THIS point in the skin care game I feel like we should know how to have SPF that doesn't leave a white cast on our skin. I don't want to look like an extra in Blade or Twilight.,0

Peels",3,When I try to put makeup on over this it peels off all over my face (even when I out on moisturizer first). That tells me the formula isn’t very moisturizing. I only use this when I’m not putting anything else on my face (which is rare). It could work for me in summer but I usually go for a higher SPF.It didn’t break me out which is good but I’ll be using this for my hands in my car,5

Peels if not applied in thin layers. Time Consuming.",3,"This was the first time I tried a moisturizer sunscreen combination and I was disappointed for several reasons.1. A thin layer must be applied, otherwise it peels off. Multiple layers must be applied for full protection.2. It leaves a white cast unless it is patted into the skin. Which takes about 5 minutes per layer.3. Leaves the skin a bit oily.The product does well in the following areas:1. It Moisturizes2. It is affordable3. Offers protection from the sun if you are willing to undertake the application process.All in all, I would say it’s okay but I would not buy again because it is too time consuming.",11

It's meh.",3,"I'm disappointed in this product, as my experience with Cerave's other products have been lovely.1 pump of this moisturizer is barely enough to cover your face, but if you use 2 pumps, it's too much and begins to pill, badly. It leaves a white sheen and takes a while to absorb. The smell is faint--my husband doesn't notice it, it just smells like sunscreen to me. I've also had a couple instances of breakouts, though I can't be sure if it's related to switching to a new moisturizer or an issue with the product itself. My face is mostly fine now, but I had to switch back to what remains of my old moisturizer for a couple days to even things out.Once you get outside (Florida heat) and sweat, it feels like the moisturizer is just melting right off, regardless of how long it's been since you applied it. If it's still early morning and you go right back indoors, you'll be fine.Comparing it to the old Aveeno simply radiant, Aveeno wins. I can't say for the new Aveeno recipe, however.For the size and price point, it's okay, and if you only use one pump, you probably won't have any pilling issues--but it might not be enough coverage. The only thing I really like about this product is that it's SPF30 and has no other fragrances. The only reason I switched moisturizers is because Aveeno changed their ingredient list. Once I've used this up, I'll be trying something else.",9

It's not you, CeraVe AM, it's me",3,"As much as I use an enjoy other CeraVe products, including the hydrating face wash, night cream, and eye repair cream., I really don't have good results with this.  No matter how little I use or how carefully I apply, It never seems to absorb completely into my skin and leaves a white cast all over my face. (I have a medium olive complexion.) What's worse is that the slightest amount of perspiration causes it to immediately start dripping down my forehead into my eyes, and especially makes my nose feel all wet and greasy - so forget about using it when it's even slightly warm outside or if I have to do any kind of physical activity.Given that many others seem to swear by this, I have to think it is some kind of reaction with my particular skin. In the meantime, I'll keep searching for a another daytime facial moisturizer with SPF instead of this one.",25

Sounds good, but pills terribly",3,"I have to agree with the other reviews that say it’s not very moisturizing, you definitely need to have it on top of something like that already which I feel like should be unnecessary if it’s supposed to be a moisturizing lotion that ‘keeps your skin moisturized through the day.’ Combining it with a moisturizer does not work well, as it already pills up so badly by itself with and without makeup. I’m sure the sunscreen aspect is just fine otherwise, but it’s hard to see past the other downsides. I think I’ll have to try another kind next time.",0

OK, But Leaves A white Residue",3,"A dermatologist suggested I start using a good facial moisturizer with sunscreen to prevent the formation of more dark spots on my face and address my dry, flaky skin. After much research, I figured I'd try therapy CeraVe AM and CeraVe PM. I like the PM better because it tends to apply seamlessly and is lightweight and goes on clear. The CeraVe AM provides moisture,  but it leaves my face with a somewhat tight feeling and a light white residue. As an African-American woman, the last thing I want is a white cast on my face making my skin look ashy. I had to go back and apply a little of the PM on top of the AM. or add the Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum on top of the CeraVe AM to make my face feel less tight and get rid of the white residue left from the CeraVe AM.. this combination seems to be working well. I'm not sure if I would purchase the CeraVe AM again. I think next time I'll try something better suited for African-American skin so I don't have to combat the white residue.",7

This is an extremely small amount",3,I was so surprised when I saw how small the bottle was and the consistency of the product is not smooth and creamy.  It even had an odor to it as if it was old even though it was not expired.  I am much happier with my oil of Olay ....if you are going to buy it...go to the store and you will know what you are getting.,0

Not for me. The positives are it is lightweight and does protect your face from every day sun exposure. I would recommend more protection on sunny days.",0

*UPDATED* Decent moisturizer, wish bottle was sealed",3,"Began using retinol, so I needed moisturizing and sun protection in the AM. Normally use Cetaphil lotion but wanted something more substantial. I thought this was overpriced, but the quality is definitely higher. The lotion is richer, absorbs nicely, slight tackiness (but dries nicely), skin feels soft/moist after applying. Package was intact when received, however a hermetic seal would have been nice to have! There was much empty space in the bottle, no way of telling if it was shorted without emptying and measuring.*Updated* I had to return to correct the rating. After using for a few weeks, I began noticing the 'white cast' or 'flaking' that occurs when you apply and then rub in. It is really annoying when the residue hangs off your face. I didn't notice as much at first, but I wear glasses and didn't realize how bad it was. You have less flaking if you are able to apply to all parts of face before it begins drying. Once that starts, if you have a buildup of lotion, it will begin rubbing into flakes. Disappointed.",7

Sunscreen NOT daily moisturizing lotion",3,"I was looking for a daily face cream with spf but this is not it. This goes on with the feel and smell of Elmer's white glue. The smell dissapates quickly but the texture is thick and takes a lot of time and rubbing to absorb completely into skin. Putting make up on over it is out of the question, no matter how long you wait before doing so. I wash and prep and exfoliate beforehand and it still pills and comes off the skin with make up application. I guess I will save this for summer when I can freely apply it every 2 hours like sunscreen and not as part of a morning skin care routine.",0

It's ""ok""",3,It a good sunscreen if you are using it by itself. It can't be applied on top of ANYTHING without balling up. I don't wear foundation or anything but even on top of my other skin care products it suck. I'll use what I have but I won't buy this again.

Okay product",3,Overall I think the product does a good job at moisturizing but isn't the greatest one I've seen. I love the Cerave brand but this product does have a smell that I don't care for and in the summer makes my face a lot greasier and shiny that other products. I think that for people with more oily skin should stay away from this unless they want shiny skin all the time.,0

Kinda of disappointed with the texture and thick feeling of product.",3,"I really like Cerave light weight Lotion for my face. So I decided to give this SPF 30 cerave sunscreen a try. I am not a fan of sunscreens but with today's sun, the UVA UVB rays is damaging to skin. So decided to start using sunscreen.  I felt like this Sunscreen was thick and felt like the sunscreens one would use for beach days etc.  After applying it looks oily but absorbs quickly on face if you apply small amounts at a time.  If you try to apply a large quantity at once, it will take awhile to disappear from skin.  It didn't feel moisturizing either. This product felt like my pores couldn't breathe. After washing it off, my skin felt dried out and I have combination skin. It didn't feel like a moisturizer but again more of a sunscreen.  I have skin that's prone to occasional acne and need a product that is light and breathable for my skin. I am on the verge of returning this sunscreen but still deciding if to keep it and wear on days where I am going to be in direct sun for more than 2 hours like the Parks, beaches etc.  I don't think I will be purchasing this Cerave AM face lotion with spf 30 again.",4

A little too thick",3,"This was my first time buying a moisturizer with added sunscreen and I was excited to try this. It seems to not irritate my sensitive skin and it has a pleasant smell, however, it is very thick, quite difficult to absorb, and it often leaves white streaks. I will continue to use this through the summer, but I am not sure I would purchase this again. I feel as though I may as well have just applied plain sunscreen.",0
