Perfect for my combo skin",5,"I have oily skin with occasional patches of dryness - this product work well and makes my face feel evenly smoothe. I had used retinol and my face was super dry and flakey for a few days - this moisturizer quickly calmed my skin and made it soft... Initially I thought it would be too thick for me because I wear makeup - but it has been fine, once my make up is applied, it hasn't been a problem.",2

Low/no white cast",5,"Great for medium to dark skin tones. It does leave a white cast when you apply, but that fades away pretty quick. I try to avoid applying a second & third coat cause then the white cast comes back. I put this on in the mornings (use it as my moisturizer) and then use a different sunscreen if I need to reapply in the afternoon.",9

Sunscreen",5,"I am 64 with dry face.  I was looking to buy a am moisturizer.  I was told CeraVe was a good one for your face.  I did not realize it was also a sun screen.

Great daily moisturizer with SPF",5,"CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 is a true skin-saver in my daily routine. With its exceptional 4.8-star rating, it's clear that many others have found this product to be a gem.The inclusion of SPF 30 in a daily facial moisturizer is a game-changer. It offers reliable sun protection while keeping your skin hydrated and healthy. As someone who prioritizes skincare, I appreciate the non-comedogenic, oil-free formula, which means it won't clog pores or cause breakouts.The lightweight texture is perfect for daily wear, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It serves as an excellent base for makeup, too.CeraVe is known for its dermatologist-recommended products, and this one is no exception. It contains essential ceramides that help maintain the skin's natural barrier, leaving it smooth and nourished.I've rated it just shy of 5 stars because, while it's an outstanding product, I sometimes wish it came in a larger size, as I go through it relatively quickly with daily use. Nevertheless, CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 is a must-have for those looking to simplify their skincare routine without compromising on sun protection and hydration. Highly recommended!",36

A Keeper!",5,"I love this sunscreen! I've used multiple facial sunscreens in my many years to protect my face and I keep coming back to this one. I use sunscreen every day and this is one of my go to products.The only negative I can come up with is that I wish it had a higher SPF, like 45. I also wish it came in a tinted formula. I use this product for days around the house or out for a walk in the neighborhood. I also use this product on the backs of my hands and my neck and chest areas daily and when I've applied another tinted brand of sunscreen to my face when I want more coverage or higher SPF. I use to just mix a bit of my foundation with it in the palm of my hand but have gotten lazy in my old age and just buy the tinted sunscreen now for my face to use as a foundation.I like this sunscreen so much that I've bought this to give to my sister, who's a no makeup type of gal, to help save her skin from looking ancient as she ages. You will love this product too!",0

Great value moisturizer with spf 30",5,"For years I’ve used Cera Ve moisturizing cream (the one in the tubs) due to my dermatologist’s recommendation. Recently I’ve been concerned about a daily sunscreen, not just one to wear when I’m actually going out in the sun. Since I was going to use it for all day I wanted it to be non greasy/oily and non scented. In other words I wanted not to be aware I was wearing it.I’m glad I decided to try this lotion with sunscreen as it fulfills my previously mentioned requirements. Also a very little goes a long way!  Just one push on the dispenser gives me enough lotion to cover my face so I should be able to make a bottle last a few months (at least in winter).I always wash my face with warm water before applying and the lotion goes on so nicely.I’ve already started recommending to friends and family.",0

A completely honest and non-paid review.",5,"No, I'm not being paid for this first of all.I'll leave two different points that I consider important at the moment of choosing.One, if you are looking for a low budget skin care having only face cleaner, sun protection, moisturizer (like me) I'd say this is not the best option? Why?This product is really small, and the prize is fair because it has hialuronic acid (which if u buy it on its own is like $14) is a mixed of many good things you'd usually buy separate and is would be more expensive, so the price is excellent.BUT, you can get a nitrogena sun screen 50 fps (higher than this product's and smells amazing) for $9,99 that is farly bigger, a $16,99 rocche possay and a CeraVe daily moisturizer for $10,99 (that u can not only use in face but also body without fearing its gonna run out immediatly) and that'll last you LONGER since it's 8 ounce not only 3, I like to keep my skincare simple and affordable.Now, secondly, if the mixture is something you're interested in and can/want to afford a little more and expend more often, this is your product for sure, doesn't feel heavy on my face (i have oily face) it blends super easily and smells good, like an usual sunscreen does.",7

Best Am Moisturizer!",5,"This product cleared my skin up. I love all CeraVe  products, they work wonders for my skin! Only thing I have a problem with this moisturizer is that it flakes if you add too much and if it's raining and you get rain on your face, when it comes off it will start to turn white on your skin, but, other than that I can work my way past this product since it clears up my skin.  One time I accidentally slept in this moisturizer before taking it off and I woke up the next day with clear skin. Amazing delivery too and fast arrival. :)",8

 I really like this lotion with SPF 30. My dermatologist likes it too. It rubs in easily without a white residue and it’s not greasy. Sometimes I wear it over my face serum / regular face lotion, and sometimes just straight on my bare face. Good to wear under makeup as well. I recommend!",2

Light ""sunscreen"" scent, dries quickly, moisturizes face",5,"I really like this product.Pros:- Includes SPF protection to protect your face from the sun. I like that it includes it so you're not layering products on your face as much.- A little goes a long way. You don't need much and it is easy to spread and rub into your face.- The CeraVe brand has been around a while and I trust that it's bringing back healthy moisture to my skin. I've not had a dry face since I started using it.Cons:- It sometimes feels heavy and can leave face feeling ""slick"". It's not bad, I still use and will continue to buy the product, but I wish it dried as cleanly as other products do (such as their lotion for nighttime). But I suspect the sunscreen combo is the reason it feels heavier on the skin.- It does have a ""sunscreen"" fragrance. Which I like personally but if you're looking for something that doesn't have a smell at all, then it might not be for you. It is very light though.",28

Great Moisturizer!",5,"CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizer is my 3rd favorite product in CeraVe’s facial product line-their Facial Cleanser for oily skin & their PM Facial Moisturizer being my top 2 favs. CeraVe is my go brand for facial products. With having oily skin & at one time acne, I’ve tried many products, some good, some no good. I’ve done a lot of research into what my skin needed for optimal look & health. I’ve always gone back to CeraVe. What they offer in their AM Moisturizer is gold for our skin. The 3 essential ceramides, niacinamide (B3-which helps build skin cells while protecting them from environmental stresses) & hyaluronic acid-which retains water to help the tissues in our skin well lubricated & moist as well as a ton of other benefits!) are 3 key ingredients our skin needs. With this moisturizer being SPF 30 it’s a good amount of sun protection for our face. The lotion is scent free. The 3oz. bottle goes a long way for the price. This cream I don’t consider to be lightweight though vs. their PM moisturizer. It’s heavier. This is where it shows like it is more of a sunscreen cream vs. a moisturizer but it is doing its thing by protecting my skin. This does leave my face with an oily residue. This is the only downside for me with having oily skin & using this moisturizer. To help with that problem I apply my favorite primer once the moisturizer has set in. Then I apply my powder, either loose or compact. Once all of that is in place I see no oil & I know my face has protection from the sun as well as benefiting from all that the moisturizer has. Since Winter hit & I’m not outside, some days never the AM I use the PM moisturizer which is much lighter. Overall this is the perfect moisturizer to entail into your skincare regime. I have it on my subscribe & save list so I save a little extra & order when needed. One bottle lasts me 3 months or longer. I hope this helps to give you an idea as to why this moisturizer is so good. Wonderful quality at an affordable price. Highly recommend!",16

Now part of my morning routine",5,"I use a product that has retinol as part of my nightly face regimen. I was told that using a sunscreen during the day is a must since retinol can cause more sun sensitivity. I had a few saved when I was talking to my mom about it. She recently had a precancerous lesion on her face treated and her dermatologist recommended CeraVe as a daily moisturizer. He specifically mentioned their AM cream because it has the added sunscreen. Apparently my grandmother also used this product for years after switching from Olay products. I decided to order it.I wash my face with soap and water every night but do not use soap in the morning. I rinse well instead and use a toner to clean. I then apply an eye cream (not CeraVe but I'm looking into theirs) and a light face serum. After both have dried, I apply this and let set before applying any makeup, which I admittedly don't wear much. I've only been using for a short time but my skin feels so much softer. The fact that it has the added protection of a sunscreen is such a huge bonus for me. The bottle isn't huge but you don't need a lot so it lasts. I have senstive skin and this hasn't caused any issues for me. I will be using this daily in the morning from now on.",49

Part of my morning routine",5,"I used to not wear sunscreen because I was too lazy to do so before rushing to work. I watched a reviewer recommend getting a 2-in-1 and recommended some brand that I forgot. I figured, hey since I have so many Cerave products, might as well give it a shot. Searched and found that one exists, so instantly ordered one! It's pretty easy to spread, I don't see any white after spreading the moisturizer for a bit. One thing I do wish would be an option for higher SPF! I think many people would appreciate having the 2nd option with a higher SPF!",9
