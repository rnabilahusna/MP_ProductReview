Do your research!",3.0,"If there was ever a supervillain in the comics that I could easily play the role of, he would have the name, Oil-O man. The skin on my face is so oily, it's alien. I read the negative reviews here, those claiming this thing strips your face dry, and I thought, well, this is what I was looking for. Nope! I'm still an oily mess after much use of this product. At this point, I'm convinced there's no cure for me, and I will remain an oily mutant for ever.With that said, do your research. Oily skin is as much an internal problem as it is an external one. Oil absorbing products will only do so much. My triglycerides are through the roof, because it's necessary for me to have it that high. I'm sure this is the main cause of my extreme sebum production. Finding a balance will forever be an ongoing battle for me.This product does mattify your skin, indeed, but like wolverine and his healing powers, my oil producing powers kick in overdrive soon after. Only if I could sell it as fuel...now that would be something. If you have super, and I mean, super oily skin...this will only help you for about a couple hours, tops.",2

Okay product",3.0,"I have oily acne prone skin where either you can slip and slide on my face due to oil. I’m addition to the oily skin, my pores get clogged and hence the acne. Even with this skin type you still have to be careful what you wash your face with - not anything drying that makes your face produce more oil or a face wash that won’t remove the excess so no acne.Unfortunately this face wash didn’t really do anything for my face or acne. I would wash once and I could still feel the oil on my face so I would double cleanse and feel my face clean. My testament on  any product is how my face will react by the end of the day; didn’t really do anything for my acne (main concern). So I would recommend this product for customers who don’t have acne prone skin and want a wash to have a basic cash wash.",0

I tried this stuff for about a year and it worked for, say, the first few months, but my acne eventually returned. It wasn't as bad as before, but I wanted to be acne-free, so I moved on to another product, which I love. This isn't to say that the product is bad, because it's not; it's just a little too gentle for my face. If all you need to do is cleanse, then this is probably right for you.",2

You usually don't have to use too much to work up a good lather. However, I have noticed that it doesn't clean my face properly and I usually tone my face after cleansing with it and their still a fear amount of dirt and oil on my face. I would definitely recommend using this in the morning if you may need to use a cleanser in the morning and remove any type of makeup before using this to cleanse your face. I also wish it was a little more affordable.",0

It's okay.",3.0,"I will leave a better review if I see better results. When I washed my face the first two times, my skin fealt great. But after that things changed and I noticed a couple of things about the bottle. The face wash does not have a lot number or an expiration date on the bottle, so that was a little concerning. It's a little drying on my sensitive skin. It also caused me to break out on my skin and it looks like I have little pimpes on my forehead that are not visible but I can feel them. I use cetaphil moisturizer and am soonswitching to rose oil. I included images of before and after using the cleanser.",14

Too strong for me!",3.0,"I am a 35 year old woman who is still very much acne prone so I thought this face wash would be helpful. I took into account that while I'm acne prone, my skin is also very sensitive, so I only used this once at night and every other night over a two week period. Well, even that proved to be too strong for me. It dried my (oily) skin to the point that it became flaky and red with irritation in certain spots. I have since discontinued use of the medicated cleanser, but I do use Effaclar's gel foaming cleanser as well as the mat moisturizer and I'm very happy with those products.",2

Drying",3.0,Extremely drying even for oily skin. It stripped me of my natural oils completely and actually burned my fit head.

Just okay.",3.0,"While I enjoy the scent, I try to avoid using scented products on my face as they tend to irritate me.

It states in the product name it's a foaming gel, yet foam it does not.  I even tried it with a plain wash cloth and it did foam a little but not much.  It does do a good job in cleansing even sensitive oily skin even with the facial brush but if you're looking for something foamy it doesn't meet the grade.",0

Decent, but should be less price wise",3.0,"Good, but not sure it's worth the price. I usually use Lancome face wash, but I was in a crunch so I bought this instead this time.  It is only a few dollars less than the one I usually use, but it's not quite as nice.  It does seem to clean well, though.  But, it has a soapy/chemical smell even though it says soap free.  It also doesn't foam as much as I like my face wash to for easy spreading purposes.  But, it is decent.  I don't think at this price I'd reorder, though.",0

Skip this, buy the moisturizer",3.0,"I've really enjoyed the La Roche-Posay moisturizer but the purifying gel feels like it strips your face a bit too harshly. While I do feel it cleanses, I am not convinced it is keeping my skin healthy. I've needed to moisturize 3 fold since I started using this product and the ""foaming"" is minimal in comparison to other brands. From now on it will be used as a body acne cleanser only.",25

Break outs",3.0,This did the exact opposite of clearing my skin. It actually caused more blemishes. My dermatologist recommended it unfortunately it's not good at all,0

dried my skin out",3.0,"this damaged my moisturizer barrier after 2 weeks of using.  my skin was very red and irritated. even putting on my niacinamide stung. i wasn't using introducing any other actives. it seemed to be helping at first because  within the first 3 days it dried out all of my breakouts.  after a week i noticed my skin was so incredibly dry after washing my face. even after moisturizing. i stopped using this and switched back to a gentle hydrating cleanser and the redness of my skin calmed down. overall it does deep clean, but i don't think its gentle enough for everyday use.",0

Use Sparingly",3.0,"A little goes a long way with this gel cleanser. Because it does not make much foam, you may be tempted to use more than you need, which wastes product and may irritate your skin.I found that this worked moderately well when I used it every other day, because more frequent use was overdrying. Even though it says it has been tested for sensitive skin, using it just once a day was too aggressive for my skin – and the product information says you can use it morning and evening.Not a fan of the fragrance, but others may like it.",0

... have just started using the foaming gel and I like it so far",3.0,"I have just started using the foaming gel and I like it so far. However, the packaging is terrible (leaked all over the inside of the amazon box) and it's frustrating that there are no instructions written on the bottle. Not that it's rocket science, but it would still be nice to have specific details of use.",0

Not for me",3.0,"I always try to use a facial cleanser other than soap on my face. This did get my skin very clean, and I didn't feel dry and tight afterward, so maybe there is something to the PH balance in this cleanser. It also seems like an effective cleanser, so it would clean pores and remove makeup. I also like that it has zinc and is made with spring water.The thing I didn't like about this cleanser was the chemical smell. Maybe it's the zinc or some other ingredient, but when I used this I could smell a chemical smell which surprised me since I was expecting a gentle cleanser. I also became concerned that I didn't want to get this stuff in my eyes as I lathered up my face. It may be an ok face wash, but for me, the ingredients and the smell seemed too harsh.",0

Average face wash",3.0,"So I'm not a skincare expert but love to try new things. I'm giving this three stars because it's just very meh. I've noticed no changes and while it is supposedly better for your skin, it's certainly not something I can tell by the naked eye. It's an average face wash. Nothing extraordinary and probably will not go out of my way to buy again.",0
