Did not take off oil off face",2,"Was looking for a product that would help me with oily face. Tried it for days and product did not wash of oil off face. Product ladders well but does clean fairly ok, but its not for oily skin like what it says. Switching over to other product.",0

Feels smooth and last for a long time, but didn’t clean my face well.",2,"For context, I have oily, acne prone skin. So the pros are even though it’s fragrance free, the smell is really nice. Other pro is the product lasts a long time so if you buy this bottle and use one pump 2 times a day, expect for it to last like 5 months tops. Other than that, I feel like this cleanser does not clean my skin very well. Maybe it’s the moisturizing benefits from the cleanser, but I don’t feel fully clean like how I would with la roche posay cleanser. I also sense that I get oily faster through the day with this cleanser so it doesn’t control my oils well. I really wanted to love this cleanser since so many people love it, but it’s not my favorite. Might buy in a few years but for now, I’ll stick with my la roche posay cleanser.",0

I shouldn’t have bought this.",2,"I’m female and 16 years old. I get a good amount of hormonal acne and pimples. I switched to this product from Proactiv products. I regret it. This face wash is gentle on the skin and has no bad odor and I’m sure is great for sensitive. I DO NOT recommend this if you have acne. I switched to this because it is cheap and I should have stuck with proactiv. I used this product the past two months. When using proactiv I only had some acne on my forehead and less texture and less scarring. Switching to this face product broke me out. I get pimples and acne on my cheeks and lower face which I have NEVER had before in the past. I now have scarring on my lower face. I get pimples almost daily/every other day since using this product. I’m unhappy with the product, my acne has already been my biggest insecurity and now its worse. People are different, it may work for some it may not for others but personally it just made my acne worse than it already is. Moral of the story, I would not get this if you are prone to acne, do not risk it. I understand it’s a good budget but in my opinion not good quality.",0

It also does not foam up at all, considering it is a foaming cleanser which I find weird.

Tread with caution - Loaded with Propylene Glycol",2,"I am one of the biggest supporters and users of almost all Cerave products. I am currently using the Hydrating Cleanser, Renewing Lotion and Eczema Body wash. My 2 year old uses the Baby Wash and Baby lotion from Cerave.So far, this foaming facial cleanser is the only Cerave product that I have a serious concern with. The 7th ingredient is 'Propylene Glycol' and it may sound like not a lot but think it this way - all the good stuff like hyaluronic acid & all Ceramides are after Propylene Glycol. Whatever good is going to come from the 'good' stuff will be mitigated by PG. Propylene Glycol is a know skin sensitiser and you can ready plenty about it on Google or elsewhere. If you have sensitive skin or conditions like rosacea/eczema/psoriasis, this cleanser will sting your skin and /or cause a rash or acne in the very first week. If you have normal skin, it will eventually sensitive your skin and it will thereafter start reacting to PG. I just don't understand why a super awesome brand like Cerave can't use something better like Butylene Glycol instead. I have written to them but they have not reacted. I seriously hope they can replace this ingredient with a safer ingredient as I really need a foaming facial cleanser and it kills me to use other brands.",337

Cleanses, but *Really* dries out my skin",2,"I use this in the shower or to take off my makeup, and its pretty good value, like, it will take a pretty long time to finish this bottle, but that's not so great if the product doesn't work for you. It feels so dry and itchy, kind of like when you put too much powder on top of your foundation, you know? Does not moisturize at all. and I have relatively oily skin, so if you have normal or dry skin this is certainly not the product for you.",0

Four Months of Usage & Disappointment",2,"If it helps, I have African American skin. I wanted something to help aid in healthy skin. I used this for months, twice a day in the morning and before bedtime.Around the first few months, I massaged the foam with my fingers onto my face as it turned into foam once you move it circular motion. After a few seconds, the form disappears, but the stuff is still on your face. Then it says to rinse your face. Afterward, it left my face so dry that it felt like my face wanted to stretch from being so stiff. Sometimes I had to resort to putting on lotion afterward to get rid of that irritable feeling. I do have oily skin. But sometimes the extreme dryness was just too much.I then got a rotating facial brush and used CeraVe with that, thinking if I applied by a different method other than my fingers, I could probably see some results. I also left the foam on my face longer by putting on first, then brushing my teeth, and after my teeth are clean, I then rinse my face. But I got the same outcome.It does not have a smell, nor have I experienced it bothering my eyes.I still experienced acne. So, this wasn't any kind of miracle worker for me.I gave it two stars for two reasons, 1) It did not seem to make my skin worse. So, that's a plus. And 2) becuase for $8 to $10 you really do get your money's worth in terms of quantity. It's a big bottle and it will take forever to use every bit of it. But I'm down to at least 25% left, and I don't think I'm even going to bother with the rest. I'm now moving on to another product. There's no reason for me to even waste my time any further this foam. But at least it was worth a shot.",5

I thought it seemed AWFULLY SMALL and so I double checked my order & sure enough I was CHARGED for the my ounce bottle, but only RECEIVED one 8oz container. Also, the whole order was just thrown in a way-too-big box (an increasingly inconvenience, as we only have room for ""so much"" recyclable material storage and/or garbage as last resort. The tape on this big box was so loose it fell apart as I lifted it from my porch. I feel like Amazon employees are just having a working strike and doing whatever the heck nowadays LOL 😂 The box pickers are definitely choosing oversized boxes! We recently got a medium pouch of dog food & it came in the size box you would get if you bought a brand new PRINTER with all the styrofoam etc.  SUCH A WASTE. And THE KICKER?

Buy At Your Own Risk",2,"I really had hopes for this product as it had a lot of great reviews and I’m in need of a face wash that can get my clear skin back.Six days in and I absolutely have to stop using it. After three days I noticed my forehead would feel like skin is coming off and that part of my face would burn before bed. I started using a serum at the same time so I needed to determine which product it was. I took notice on day five that the burning feeling would happened after I washed my face and applied toner (but before the serum). Having used witch hazel toner for a few years, I knew that wasn’t the case.I know see less than a week in, my entire face is extremely dry when my original problem was oily skin. I wish I could get my money back.",4

This is not foamy!",2,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I’m so disappointed in this product. I love foam soaps - this is not it. It bubbles when I put it on my face but I wouldn’t call it foam. And it doesn’t rinse off. My face is slickery no matter how much water I use. Lastly, the container fails the ergonomic test. The top is much lower than other pumps, prompting me to pull it up — and the top comes right off! This particular bottle is heavy. If I grab it and it slips out of my hand, guess what happens? The top pops off. Of course I don’t have my glasses so I can’t put the top back on. Overall, not a great experience.",5

Dry... Then SO oily!!!",2,"It felt really nice the first few times I used this product. I’ve saw some mixed reviews, but thought i’d give Cerave a chance since I was trying to get my skin on a less drying (i used all benzoyl peroxide based products before, but I still wanted something that claimed to help with my acne spots) regimen.... I have combination skin. oily t-zone and dry around the outside of my face with light acne (especially around my chin where I hold my phone at work). After about a week I started breaking out so bad, it started getting out of control. It started drying up my face, but by the end of the day my whole face was a war zone. SO oily that it would soak through all layers of a thick sheet of toilet paper/paper towel. I had never been that oily before, and that’s saying something for me! Every product works differently for other people. It just didn’t work for me. Just giving my honest opinion.",44

Oddly I am very allergic to this",2,"CeraVe has suddenly become the holy grail skin care product lately it seems. Well at least to a newbie skincare person like me. What totally blew my mind was the fact that this is the 1st product I have EVER used that made me break out. I thought there was no way since all I've used before were much ""lower"" grade products with much harsher chemicals. But alas, it was true. I got hard red rashes on my face and had to calm it down by putting oatmeal on it for weeks. I even tried to use it again after my skin calmed down and would react again to it. I had to give it to a friend whom reported she had no issues.I'm not sure if it's fair to give less stars b/c i'm personally allergic to it but this was my personal experience. I especially got excited b/c they started carrying this brand in a lot of the local stores!",17

nukes your face",2,"i've never really had skin issues. i'm not prone to breaking out, nor am i prone to dry or flaky skin. i've never had a problem with a face wash drying out my skin. even bar soap or bronner's is fine.i just wanted a generic, good-quality face wash. this was the most popular form of cerave, which i'd heard good things about, so i figured i should be safe with a product labeled 'normal to oily.' boy was i mistaken. every time i use this product i come out of the shower with a completely red face, feeling like i've just lost my epidermis.i was told by other people that i should've gone for the milder version of this stuff, but a product labeled with 'normal' should work for normal skin. the only reason i'm giving this two stars and not one is because i suppose it would work for people with oily skin. everyone else BEWARE.",6

Doesn't work for me",2,"Was really excited to use this product as I've read through countless of good reviews.. However, this wasn't good for my skin and made it worst. Been having a really bad acne breakout, but after using this, the breakout seemed to spread... causing my whole face to be red. I thought it could be a ""purging"" period but my skin kept getting dryer, causing flaking in my skin. Wanted to see how it would go for a while, so I waited a month but new cystic acne seemed to pop up and I decided, nope, this really doesn't work for me. Currently using cetaphil, and while I do still have acne, it seem to slowly calm the state of my face. I know how hard is it to go through acne, so I wish luck for all to find a face regimen that would help their own skin!",20

When I tried it, i did enjoy the texture. It's almost like a gel before you add the water. I used this product for about a week and a half. I started seeing small pimples hear and there and figured it was just normal out break. Only they increased daily with few going away. I was also noticing the eczema on my neck was flaring up. I had to stop using the product. About 2 days after switching to my old cleanser my face cleared considerably. Its now pretty blemish free . My eczema is still an on going battle.
