A Holy Grail for Happy Skin!",5,"CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser is the MVP in my skincare routine, gently and thoroughly cleansing my face while providing for my skin's needs.This cleanser's gentle formula is a total game-changer. It's perfect for all skin types; it removes dirt, excess oil, and makeup without drying out my skin. The light, foamy texture adds a refreshing touch that other cleansers haven't been able to match.CeraVe's cleanser was developed with dermatologists which if highly noticeable in its quality and gives me reassurance when using the product. This cleanser lives up to their reputation, being gentle, fragrance-free while not clogging pores.When using this cleanser's it's hydrating powers help maintain my skin's natural barrier, keeping it soft and hydrated even after cleansing. This has been a lifesaver for my dry and sensitive skin.The pump dispenser is a extremely useful. It allows me to dispense just the right amount of product without waste and keeps things clean.If you're seeking a gentle yet effective facial cleanser that addresses various skincare concerns then it is a must-have. I'm beyond happy with this cleanser, and it's become a staple in my skincare routine. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality facial cleanser.",6

Dermatologist Recommended Face Wash",5,"My dermatologist recommended this face wash to me, and I’ve been using it ever since.  I was previously using a face wash with benzoyl peroxide that left my face dried out and constantly needing moisturizer.  After making the switch to this, my skin is a lot less dry and sensitive.This foams up nice and easily, and feels very clean and light on the skin.  There’s no noticeable smell, and overall just feels like you’re barely using anything at all, yet it gets the job done.  You hardly need to use much at all every time, so each bottle lasts a really long time.  I’d highly recommend this.",9

Hands Down Best Wash Ever for Combo, Acne-Prone Skin (Even Mature, Sensitive Skin)",5,"I purchased a 3oz bottle of this from my local store, which lasted a long time by the way. I decided I loved it enough to order the larger value size.I have experimented with different washes for years, different acne remedies for years, and never quite got 100% perfect skin for my trouble. I've spent thousands (no exaggeration) on washes, skincare, treatments, doctors. I've tinkered with YT suggestions, DIY potions, all natural, multi-step kits, suggested regimens like 5 or 10 step Korean skincare. I've eliminated foods from my diet, attempted to regulate hormones, etc. None of it did much to improve my overall complexion. Recently, I started struggling with blackheads and unflattering texture along my jawline alongside my acne and needed to change it up.After watching Dr. Dray on YT (great dermatologist out of TX who promotes a less is more approach to skincare), I purged everything that had, especially anything with superfluous fragrance and dyes and went back to basics. Per her suggestion, I had been using the CeraVe hydrating cleansers. I have sensitive skin and while I'm oily in places, I've heard hydrating cleansers are ideal overall. The hydrating version did nothing for my oil, the cause of my blackheads. I'm sure it would be fine for someone who has dry skin, but I needed something to cut the oil without over-drying. This foaming version of the same brand's cleanser breaks down the excess oil without overdrying the face and works well as a second step if you do the two-step oil cleansing method (which I do to remove sunscreen and makeup). It's fragrance-free, dye-free, pH balanced, loaded with ceramides, etc..you know the drill. All the good, little to no bad as far as I can tell.Ultimately, I've found [for me] I have to wash morning and night. None of this, splashing a little warm water on my face in the morning and you only have to wash once. It is not enough for someone with skin that likes to lean on the oily side. It's just not. Under or overwashing can both lead to other issues. So, for me 2x is plenty. I use this fantastic foaming cleanser both times, all over my face. As part of my routine, I use The Ordinary's SA 2% (only on the acne prone areas), brush my teeth to give it time to soak in, then apply their Niacinamide 10%/zinc serum. The combination of this wash, the SA, and Niacinamide has cut my oiliness considerably without drying me out. I don't feel like an oil slick mid-day. Still, I top it off with a little of the CeraVe regular moisturizer, CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid and Ceramides for Normal to Dry Skin. I don't need a lot, but everyone needs moisturizer, & then I have a great water-gel sunscreen. I use a 30 to 50spf daily on my face, neck, chest, and ears.PM - I  double-cleanse the spf and makeup off using this wash as my 2nd step after an oil-based remover, and after I've gently wiped away the excess balm or oil with a fragrance-free baby wipe or tissue. No point in struggling to remove everything with a wash alone. I don't expect any single wash to remove my spf and makeup and I'm pretty minimalist. So if you love smearing copious amounts of foundations, powders, etc. on your face, you really should try to remove as much of it with removers or an oil-cleanse before you try to wash it with this. I use this wash, SA 2% (again only on the acne prone areas), the Niacinamide, the CeraVe moisturizer and I'm done.I've been doing this routine for a few weeks now and the blackheads are disappearing, the hyperpigmentation is vastly improving (fading), no new acne has appeared, and the uneven texture along my jawline is almost gone. The only difference in recent months has been swapping out a hydrating wash for this foaming one for my combo, mature, sensitive skin. I can't say enough good things about it: inexpensive, effective, non-drying, not harsh, etc. I wish I had gone to this sooner, but many of us with serious skin issues are often fooled into thinking we have to pay a fortune and pile on the products in order to get great results. My advice, strip everything to the basics and build from there. I'm so pleased with this wash. I hope they don't do something stupid like reformulate it for some reason. Best to leave a great thing alone.",81

Makes my face feel clean without drying it. Very little needed for a nice lather.",5,"I am 77 years old, and had been using what I thought was a good facial cleanser. After a while, I noticed what looked like small brown spots on my cheeks. I wasn't sure whether this was just something caused by aging, but decided to try this facial cleanser.I have been using this facial cleanser for about 6 weeks. The spots on my face are gone, and the skin on my face is clear and healthy looking. I like that this cleanser produces a little lather and very little is needed to wash my face. I use an amount that would be about equal in size to 2 peas. It rinses off easily and after using my face feels clean but not dried or taut. There is no discernible fragrance. Considering the amount that I use to wash my face, this bottle should last me at least 5-6 months.I hope this review was helpful for you.",13

Super affective on very greasy skin…",5,"This is the happiest I’ve been in a very long time with a skin/beauty product. I have very oily, acne prone skin and NOTHING has helped control the oil… but I can actually feel this working. I first noticed when I tried to push my glasses up out of habit… but they didn’t need bumped up because my skin wasn't oily (therefore slipping my glasses down)! After that I took notice and it actually lasts pretty well.In the winter I also tend to get dry along my lower cheeks (though still very oily everywhere else) but this doesn't dry me out as long as I include moisturizer, which I always do.",0

Best Hydrating Cleanser! Works for both normal and oily skin.",5,"One of the best hydrating cleansers I have found for the price! It is fragranceless, which is terrible for your skin, and doesn't leave your skin feeling tight. I like that it has hyaluronic acid. I have dry skin. I use this cleanser and the CeraVe moisturizer in the tub. I use it in the morning for extra hydration, then I switch to another cleanser at night. The people who are giving this a low rating don't understand what it is for. THIS IS NOT A MAKEUP REMOVER. There are no claims that it will remove makeup. If you wear makeup, you should be taking your makeup off with some type of makeup removal product FIRST. Then go in with this cleanser.",2

Improved packaging to eliminate accidental leak in transit",5,The manufacturer added a brace to prevent the push down nozzle be triggered in transit.My bottle was well protected.I use a soft bristled toothbrush to gently facilitate the foaming action.The lack of foaming without the brushing was probably due to my skin being on the dry side.I don't have any skin condition.,0

Cleared my Hyperpigmentation",5,"I absolutely love this product.  This actually helped clean my face very well, helped minize the oil in the my T zone and helped clear my hyperpigmentation.  I am learly of using different products on my face because everything tends to cause it to burn but one thing for sure I can say is this product cleared my face, made it almost glass looking and helped make the dark spots(hyperpigmented spots go away).  I was more than thankful learning about this product.  They can be given as samples at some doctors offices and if you happen to use it do a patch test first and see how your skin reacts before believing everyones opinion.  I can only speak for self and this product and the actual product line is worth all the money I can spend.  It surely does helps.",0
