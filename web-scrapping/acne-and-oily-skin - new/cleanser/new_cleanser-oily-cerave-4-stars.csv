Great product",4,I use this facial cleanser twice daily and it since I have I combination skin more drier during the winter months. It's not too harsh and gentle on my face and neck and follow it up with the facial moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning and nighttime moisturizer at night.,0

Perfect for Oily Skin!",4,"I've discovered this gem for my oily skin in this Cleanser! It strikes the right balance between gentleness and effectiveness, removing excess oil and impurities without overly drying my face. Hyaluronic acid keeps my skin hydrated without greasiness, and niacinamide helps control oil and minimize pores.  If you have oily or breakout prone skin, give it a try your skin will thank you!Honestly the only thing they could improve on would be the scent, I get not investing much in the perfume is also how they stay so cheap compared to those luxury brands but even a light improvement in the scent would go a long way.",0

Awesome!",4,I have tried many face cleansers and love this. It makes your skin soft even while cleaning. No scent. Cleans very well. The reason I gave it 4 stars is it doesn’t remove makeup well.,2

Makes my face clean, but one thing…",4,I bought this product because I really needed a facial cleanser that could eliminate the sebum that accumulates quick on my face. The bottle is a fair size and has a good pump that pumps out just the right amount.One drawback. This leaves my skin feeling very dry although I have very oily skin. After using one pump my skin feels rough and not soft. I sometimes get irritated and start to develop an itch on my face. To combat this I used a little less than a pump and it worked.Pros:- Great foaming/ bubbles up with a little water- Noticeably less oil after cleaningCons:- Leaves skin rough/ not soft depending on how oily your skin is.,11

Very nice cleanser",4,"I love all that CeraVe stands for & offers in their products. This Foaming Cleanser for Normal to Oily skin has the 3 essential ceramides, NIACINAMIDE (helps calm the skin) & HYALURONIC ACID (adds plumpness & water weight to the skin). So I’m cleansing my face & receiving the extra benefit of those 2 wonderful ingredients. I do have oily skin to combination skin & it feels soft & moisturized after using this. I don’t have a “tight” feeling which is good because that means the cleanser is too harsh. This one is just right. This is a gel & it does foam up nicely. I wouldn’t suggest using onlythis cleanser to take your makeup off. It’s not strong enough for proper makeup removal. I use CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water prior to using this cleanser. It’s a double cleanse but it doesn’t dry my skin out & it’s a guarantee my skin is fully cleansed. There is a subtle scent to it. I feel it’s gentle enough for sensitive skin as mine can be at times. I did purchase their newer product the Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser for normal to dry skin to see how my skin would cleanse & I discovered a little bit of both cleansers are the perfect combination for my skin. Despite my many positives the one thing I don’t understand is why they have “oil control” on this bottle. This cleanser does not control oil. If after cleansing I moisturized only, within 30 minutes oil would be noticeable. So there is no after oil control effect, at least not for my face. This reflects my 4 star. The 19 ounce bottle is a generous size for what I paid. One hand pump only is needed for one face cleansing so a little goes a long way. I have this on my subscribe & save list so I save a little with the convenience of ordering when needed. I do recommend this product if you have oil to combination skin. It will definitely make your face feel so good.",7

90% recomendado",4,"Soy una persona con piel sensible y grasa, yo jamás tuve problemas de piel hasta los 25 años, siempre tuve 1 o 2 granitos cuando se acercaba mi periodo, después de los 25 empecé a notar que mi piel esta escamada fue muy duro para mi, pero lo merecía ya que como nunca tuve problemas pues no me cuide la piel, ni jabón ni crema usaba y rara vez protector solar, entonces mi cara paso factura, cuando  pensé en poner al día vaya sorpresa por los costos de estos productos, yo vivo en américa latina, Cerave aunque para mi no es barato ya que en solo jabón, crema y protector solar son 15 días de comida, no es muy costoso en comparación a otros productos que recomiendan los dermatólogos y duran de 3 a 4 meses, Vichy, la Roche posay, bioderma están totalmente fuera de mi canasta. Como sufro de piel sensible a los 27 años empecé con una urticaria y llevo dos años con ella (aunque es esporádica, aun no sabemos que la ocasiona), cuando uso este jabón para la cara me calma bastante solo que en ocasiones me da resequedad y debo hidratar pero con la crema de cerave noche se complementa, la crema con protector solar día de cerave aunque no es el mejor porque en ocasiones siento un poco de brillo y de vez en cuando me salen algunos comedones es una gran opción, yo no puedo usar fragancias en la piel así que estos productos para su precio son muy buenos. Este será mi tercer pedido y lo recomiendo.",4

Excellent product",4,"This product is excellent- the shipping costs twice as much as the product itself, but it was still worth it. I have had acne for years, and only in the last year or so I started seeing a dermatologist for it, after years of trying out different expensive products not suited to my age or skin type. I even underwent facial treatments that cost upwards of ten thousand! My skin improved by leaps and bounds after seeing a dermatologist, but as the derm didn't provide a skin cleanser I struggled to find one. I turned to cheaper brands like Clean&Clear and Neutrogena, and they were okay, but they didn't seem to help control the oil level in my skin and soon after stopping the creams from the dermatologist, I could see signs of my acne starting to return. I bought CeraVe after reading all the stunning reviews, and so far I've had no complaints at all. After washing, my skin feels EXTREMELY clean and refreshed and it feels tighter even. Despite what the label says it isn't actually a foam, it's more of a gel, and I love the texture. It's scentless, which works fine as I hate the artificial smelling goop I normally get with other facial cleansers. Within a week or two of washing there was visible improvement in my skin- my face has actually become lighter and brighter. Although the back of the product says wash morning and night, I use it more than twice a day, especially after getting home from a long day and when my face feels grimy and oily. Love it, will definitely buy more and try out the other products as well. The fact that it contains ceramides is something that has my mother excited as well, since she's a fan of Dr Oz and he has recommended phytoceramides and the like as an alternative to other products that are supposed to make you look more 'youthful'.",0

A lot of gentle cleansers don't give me that foaming effect that I like so I thought I would try CeraVe",4,"Truly gentle on the skin.I have combination oily and dry skin, and a lot of other cleansers make my skin really, really dry. I needed something that didn't take all the moisture out of my skin. A lot of gentle cleansers don't give me that foaming effect that I like so I thought I would try CeraVe.I was a little hesitant at first because of all the negative reviews and horror pictures that I saw, but I'm glad I did. My skin hasn't had any bad breakouts or irritation at all. In fact, I think my skin has improved. Normally after washing my face it would feel so dry and I would have to moisturize immediately, but sometimes my face feels so supple and soft that I forget.So downside? The cleanser comes out a clear liquid and it ""foams"" but doesn't get very foamy. It gets more soapy than anything. I wouldn't call it foam. I really miss that bubbling/foaming action that other cleansers have because I feel much cleaner, but this is just okay. Another downside is that I have to do TWO washes to really get all the makeup/oil/dirt off. This cleanser is REALLY GENTLE so it doesn't pull all of the impurities off your skin, which is also why I think my skin feels so much more moisturized than it did before. I don't mind it and have gotten used to it.All skin types are different so while some break out and have bad reactions, others may not. My skin honestly feels so much healthier now than it did before. I now Subscribe and Save to this cleanser because it has been working so well for me. It's not expensive so I would recommend anyone to give it a shot. Worst case if it doesn't work with your face, use it to wash your hands.",0

It didn't really foam for me either, but it did a good job in cleaning my face, and I didn't feel any tightness after use. I can feel some tightness with the salicylic acid cleanser, and even the hydratimg cream to foam I feel tightness across my cheeks. I had non of that with this cleanser. So this will be my go to",3

I have oily skin and when I wash this, it's very gentle to my skin. it takes longer for me to get oily on my face again, to compare with Clean n Clear Burst in the morning, or any of clean n clear products for facial cleaning. although i like it, but i have to be honest that this one does make my cheek areas and around my eye brows dry in the WINTER or COLD Weather. this is good to use from Spring to Autumn. So what about WINTER? no big deal. I'm still using this one in this cold weather. what i'm doing is after I wash my face with this, I let it dry by itself, use some ALCOHOL-FREE Toner, wait for 5 mins. And then I mix 2 pumps of Aloe Vera Gel with 2 drops of Python Oil (i bought this from my country). sometimes I use emu oil instead of python. but you actually can use any kind of oil that you like. I suggest grape seed oil because it's better price and it absorb as fast as 2 others that i use.Also, I have 2 drops of oil in the sunscreen before I go out on daytime, I mix it together and apply it on my skin.All of what I'm saying above is not only keep your facial skin dry from the winter, but actually will keep moisturizing your skin as well. Once your skin got enough moist, it will secrete less oil. Isn't that what we all want, less Oily Skin :)",0

Pretty good cleanser",4,"This cleanser while it has a lot of rave reviews from what I've seen was very middle of the road for me. I don't think it's bad at all persay and each time I use it I don't feel like it dries out my skin, however with my acne prone and oily skin it hasn't really helped my skin out very much in reducing any acne. The product lathers quite well and I typically use it in the morning, which it works fantastic for, but I will say that I notice over the course of a day I have more acne develop with this product over different face washes I have tried. If you have skin that is sensitive to irritation I don't think you will have any issues as there's no strong scent in this product to me but it doesn't do a great job at neutralizing any acne for my skin.",0

Drying, but helps combat oily skin",4,"I have oily/combo skin, and this really sucks all the moisture from my face. Which is maybe not so good unless you use a good moisturizer.But when I do moisture, so it does help to wick up my greasiness, and surprisingly it actually keeps it away even if I stray from my routine, unlike before where I’d become a lil greaseball if I didn’t shower every single day, twice a day.But it also makes my skin flakey and dry if I forget to moisture, which is no good, and something I’ve never had to deal with before...So I dunno how to feel about it. If you don’t have SUPER oily skin, I’d make sure to invest in a good, lightweight moisturizer before using this product.",0

5/5",4,"A very good cheap product for sensitive skin and oily. There is no overexaggerated scent you have to worry for, its light and airy. It cleans my skin well, it moisturizes and hydrates it perfectly. I recommend pushing the pump all the way down when getting some to lather up. It is to thick to foam but I noticed it started clearing my skin up when I was being heavy handed instead of worrying for it being to thick and not foaming. It has hyaluronic acid which is a go for oily skin. Its definitely worth the price, this will probably last me a year and a half or so. Cerave and The Ordinary are brands that are good if you are sensitive looking for somewhat cheap products with healthy formulas.",0

Helping my MASKNE",4,I got this because I wanted to use something for my MASKNE. I was so red and inflamed and I would come home after wearing my mask all day and wash my face with this. So far it has helped!I will say it feels like it doesn't give moisturizer so you might have to compensate for that. It has the classic CeraVe smell but doesn't matter to me or my skin.Good price for the size and can't wait for nice skin.,0

Does not *foam* like I thought",4,Of course there are bubbles but this consistency is thick and I wish it was more lightweight and foamy and it’s clear.. I was hoping for a creamy shiny mousse blend.Still works greats it’s just that I had something else in mind when I saw foaming cleanser. Words matter and all soap Is “foamy” so I was just expecting more I guess. But that’s why I only gave 4 stars,0

Great product but bad shipping experience",4,"It is gentle and does not dry my combination skin. No tightness or flaking post-cleanse which is nice. It's not necessarily foamy but I have hard water - many products do not lather well with hard water anyway - so I am not bothered by that. It's a clear gel cleanser that whitens and slightly foams during use. It does not irritate my skin or break me out, and gets the job done. Though, if you are trying to remove heavy makeup, I'd recommend double cleansing, or using makeup remover or wipes prior to cleansing.I'd been using this for a few months and bought a new bottle because it came up on Amazon's deals for almost $5 off. Good deal, but came in crappy packaging. It was shipped in a normal orange envelope with no bag or anything to seal it inside and the product leaked all over the inside of the envelope. So I don't know how much of it was lost due to the leak plus it weirds me out a bit that it was open like that. I like the CeraVe and will buy it again but not from Amazon, rather just pay a couple extra bucks for a clean full bottle at my local CVS.",0

No fragrance but quite drying for the face",4,"I tend to have pretty oily face throughout the day and after daily (morning and night) cleansing with this cleanser, I find my face flaking a bit even after moisturizer. Not sure if I’m using this too often or my face is just sensitive and I should use it like every two days. I will try to use this cleanser only 3 times a week and see how it works out for me. It does make my face feel very clean initially though.",0

Foaming face wash.",4,I'm not sure why it's called foaming face wash as it foams like any other soap.  Works as advertised but I'm not sure it's a notch above or better than any other face wash.  There is no rating on the scent as it has none.  It dispenses as a clear gel and foams after the addition of water and hand friction.,0

Great on sensitive skin but a bit drying if used daily",4,I love how it cleans my face and i love that it foams up with water. I like that its very gentle on my face too. But what i don't like is how it can slowly become drying to your skin if you use it daily like i tried to do. So i stopped using it daily and instead i use it once every other week. But since using it i have noticed how more clean my face has been and also how less oily my face is too.,0

Value is amazing, but its a little too drying for my combination skin",4,"I have been trying for a while to find a CeraVe cleanser that works for my skin. I hated the green hydrating cleanser - I felt like it didn't clean my pores effectively. So I was really hoping that this one would do the trick. I love the smell, texture, lather. Washing my face with it was great! But, unfortunately its a little too drying for my skin. It left it feeling tight and dry. Will continue on with my face wash search :(",0

Great cleanser for oily skin",4,"I've always heard such great things about CeraVe but had never tried anything from the line until now. Since I started taking better care of my skin, I ditched the assortment of other cleansers I was using and decided to start over with this one. I find that this works well on my slightly oily skin without stripping it. A little partial pump goes a long way, so I anticipate this bottle will end up lasting me quite a while. One thing I DON'T like is the smell of the ingredients. It's fragrance free, but that doesn't mean it is unscented. I'm not terribly fond of the way it smells, but the benefits of it definitely outweigh that flaw. Plays well with my other skincare items as well.",2

Very Nice For Oily Skin, Doesn't Overly Dry Out Skin",4,"My girlfriend and I have fairly oily skin, but this cleans without overly drying at all, and is pretty great as a hand soap as well. It's quite nice for removing makeup, lotion, and dirt. The only ""downside"" really is that the smell isn't necessarily pleasant, but it's quite weak and washes off with the soap as you rinse, so not much of an issue.",0

Be aware, this contains Propylparaben and Methylparaben",4,"Many people give this product a very favorable review base primarily on its effectiveness. I would advise interested buyers research the ingredient list thoroughly before purchasing this product. Like many other generic (cheaper) alternatives sold on the market, this product contains Propylparaben and Methylparaben. The former is relatively more serious with a maximum health concern score of 10 which indicates a high overall hazard while the latter ingredient scored a 4. While this may not apply to everyone, I would think a bit more research on your own may help you make more informed decision on this product. For example, if you one of your previous cleanser did not performance up to your expectation, you should try to find out the source, perhaps compare ingredient of the two products. Many people are allergic to Propylparaben so make sure you know that the inclusion of this chemical is not going to work against whatever you wish to achieve with this specific product.Personally, I enjoyed the product and so far, I am not aware that propylparaben cause any negative reactions to my skin. Like any product, do a quick research will help you go a long way!",4

Besides leaking out on arrival, great product",4,"I initially had hesitations about trying this face wash as I've read tons of reviews that claimed this caused them more breakouts and rashes. I thought I'd give it a shot. Turns out I don't have sensitive skin, as this face washed worked surprisingly well after just 3 days of use. I don't have terrible skin, just some slight red patches and the occasional big zit or two. Somehow this face wash in combination with the cerave moisturizer from the tub evened out my skin tone giving me a more even complexion. I had three people comment on my complexion within the first week of use, and I wasn't even wearing foundation. Overall I am incredibly happy and pleasantly surprised at how effective this was!! So why 4 stars? Because my bottle came with a leak and a significant amount had spilled out. As a result it got on the other packages in the same box, so I was a bit frustrated with that.",0

It works",4,"I dont typically use a foaming cleanser but I got this to use as a second cleanser after an oil cleanser, so I thought foaming could be useful. Its clear and has a thick consistency and it doesnt foam straight out of the bottle, only when you lather it, which I prefer as Im able to transfer into a smaller bottle for travel as well. I definitely dont find it to be moisturizing but no huge complaints. It smells kind of .. medical? sterile?",0
