Saved my skin",4.0,"My skin is super oily and this totally saved my skin. I used to wipe the oil off of my face during the day and now thanks to this cleanser, I don’t have to. I’m about to order my second bottle and I can tell you a little goes a long way. I typically rub the cleanser between my hands for about 15-20 seconds before I start washing my face to make more of a use for it. When I first got this a used a LOT!! I basically wasted about half of the bottle 😂. After washing your face you light feel tightness or dryness and that’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Putting that aside, when I wake up I feel like I just washed my face and I actually feel clean 🧼. I’m definitely going to buy again",10

Great Cleanser! HORRIBLE SMELL!",4.0,I really love this cleanser so far but the fragrance is awful! It’s like a mix of melted plastic & heavy perfume. I don’t understand why this even needs fragrance since it’s a product targeted for sensitive skin types. Really wish it was fragrance free. The scent is the only bad thing about this product. Other than that it’s a fantastic cleanser.,9

Use caution with dry skin!",4.0,"I bought this cleanser after using the original La Roche-Posay cleanser for a while in hopes that it would clear up my acne. Although it did seem to do a good job clearing my breakout, it also dried my skin out and left my whole face peeling after maybe 4 days of use. Good product, just use caution if you have dry or sensitive skin, maybe only use it once a day until you know how it works for you.",6

Great cleanser, wish it were fragrance free",4.0,"I’ve used the LRP Toleriane purifying cleanser for many years. I was curious how the Effaclar purifying cleanser differed, and honestly I find them to be very similar. The main difference is that the Toleriane version is unscented, and this product has a light, green floral fragrance. It’s not offensive by any means, but it is odd that they would add fragrance to a product meant for acne-prone skin. For that reason alone, I’ll go back to the one from the Toleriane line, but I do think this is a great cleanser that can break down oil, makeup and sunscreen residue, and it hasn’t caused any irritation or acne spots.",10

New holy grail?!",4.0,so I have combination /oily skin and was looking for a product that I can use to wash my face without drying it out. This product did just that to my surprise. Despite the blue bottle the liquid is actually clear and it does lather up pretty well. It doesn’t have a real scent but it has that no scent scent if that makes sense. I will definitely follow this up with some type of moisturizer too. I will say I don’t think this really treat acne but I don’t think that’s what it was intended to do it’s literally just for removing the oil off your face which it does do,0

Nice oily skin cleanser",4.0,"I'm middle aged I have extremely oily skin; have all my life.  I think I've been overly exfoliating lately and now my face is a real oil slick; gross! I purchased this as my 2nd step after using my oil cleanser.  So far, so good.  It's been about 3 weeks since I've started using it and I can definitely see a decrease in my oil production so it must be doing the job.  I also have fairly sensitive skin and I have not experienced any discomfort since I started using this.  The fragrance is light and tolerable.  The only thing is I had to take one star away due to the bottle being delivered missing the pump.  What's that all about?? Luckily, I had an extra one from an old bottle. I'd recommend this product and I most likely will purchase again.",0

FRAGRANCE",4.0,I’ve religiously used Laroche posay products for over 2 years now. I have very sensitive skin and typically the cleansers are fragrance free I was super bummed to find out that this has fragrance! I’ve only used it once but I’m worried about it causing sensitivity! Be ware!,2

Mild, but works!",4.0,"Got this product since I typically have mixed skin, and wanted to reduce some of my acne. My skin is very dry on my cheeks but seems to get oily on my forehead, and I was recommended that I moisturize more often, since oily skin can often be a result of your body trying to compensate for dry skin. In search of an acne product that wouldn't dry out my skin, a friend suggested this product. I don't use it consistently, but when I do, my skin does feel refreshed. I'm not sure how much it reduces acne, but it does help significantly in comparison to benzoyl peroxide, that dries out my skin like the Sahara Desert.If I manage to run out of this, I will likely repurchase. I even read recently that this was on the top 10 list of acne products. I'm sure this product works differently for everyone, but as this is a mild treatment, I think most people would enjoy this product.",41

Wooooheeee!!",4.0,"I have always had very oily face. Have tried many products out there. Some have worked, some have irritated my face, some haven't worked.I'm Hispanic and inherited the skin type. My Mom always said that it's an advantage because my skin wouldn't dry/crack as much and would always look younger. She's right. I'm 40 now and 99.9 % of people that I've met don't believe my age. They think I'm 25 at the most. Anyway, I bough the Trio of La Roche for oily skin. The toner helps definitely, but I've had to use other products with it so my skin stays matte for sure. What I also like is that it doesn't burn like many other toners out there *clears throat clinique*. I use it once a day and doesn't dry up my skin as much either. I'll review the rest of the trio on different posts.",0

Good but not my favorite",4.0,For background I have oily very sensitive skin with a propensity to break out. I tried this cleanser on my dermatologists recommendation.  I've been using this face wash for once a day for over an year and am only on my second bottle. It cleanses without stripping the skin of its natural oils. I don't really detect a smell from this which I love. I use this at night with my clarisonic when my acne is relatively under control. If I have a lot of breakouts or scarring from older breakouts I use the murad aha/bha cleanser instead as I feel that helps scars fade faster. I find using it twice a day too stripping so I use the body shop tea tree face wash in the morning. I highly recommend this cleanser especially for those with sensitive skin.,2

Warning: great product, but contains fragrance",4.0,"Overall, this product has really great ingredients. However, I have found an inconsistency within its advertising. It is advertised as a scent - free, fragrance - free product, but if you look closely at the ingredients list, you will find fragrance on it. It may not seem like much, but if all the products you use are fragrance free, you will find this smell quite strong. Otherwise, it's a great product. La Roche Possay should consider taking the fragrance out to make this truly a great cleanser.",0

If you want clear skin like the French...",4.0,"Though there's little foaming action it is very effective in taking off makeup (I can see it in the sink) and combating acne (surprisingly there are simple ingredients like zinc; no salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide needed). It is paraben-free, clear, and odorless. Only things that would make this 5-stars would be if it foamed more and had a refreshing smell, but that might make it more irritating to the skin. If you're looking for a more natural yet effective skin care line for acne-prone skin, I highly recommend. I now know why the French have such beautiful skin!",0

Safe choice",4.0,It cleanses well and doesn't irritate my skin. I took off one star because it leaves a slightly slippery feeling on my face (oily + acne prone) after rinsing. So this is one of the safe choices but doesn't do wonder for me either. A tube should last forever since you only need a little bit to lather.,5

Different....",4.0,Used to use another acne product by La Roche Posay -- like it better but it isn't available anymore.  So far this product is ok -- broke out after first using it but things have cleared up now.  Sometimes with acne it has to get worse before getting better.  Skin tone has improved and some of the more stubborn clogged pores have unclogged.  Overall recommend this product.,0

Great! And it works!",4.0,"I am really enjoying the items I've purchased from La Roche-Posay.

The cream (obviously) is a bit thicker and easier to handle than the gel is.",0
