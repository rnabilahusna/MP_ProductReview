Gave me the worse breakout I've had in over a decade",1,"I've always had pretty oily skin on my face, but didn't decide to start experimenting with facial cleansers until recently. I decided to try this one after having it recommended by some friends as well as my girlfriend. Unfortunately, after just a few days of use, it ended up giving me the worst breakout I've had since high school, with new acne all over my forehead, cheeks, and back of my neck. This included cystic acne, which I practically never get on my face. After noticing how severe it had gotten, I immediately switched to an acne wash from a different brand and things started to calm down.Maybe this is good for people with oily faces who aren't prone to acne, but I'd completely avoid it otherwise.",4

DAÑADO",1,"Una estafa esto, vino roto sin ninguna protección y no sirve para nada el dispensador. De paso lo compro porque se me está acabando el que tengo y me doy cuenta que este que he comprado es menos espeso que el mío, el olor es igual pero definitivamente o tiene agua o tiene otra cosa. Me arrepiento haber comprado aquí",0

Usually love the product but",1,I've been using CeraVe foaming facial cleanser for quite a while and loved it but something isn't right with this order.  Upon opening I noticed it didn't have the normal sealer on it but thought nothing of it thinking maybe because I usually order 19oz. After running out of my old bottle I started to use new one and it's watery doesn't smell like CeraVe at all and I can't feel safe using this at all.  I don't know if this is a return that got sent out or what but something is definitely not right and when to do return and usually I can go to a ups drop spot but no giving me option to with this return so I actually will have to waste more money to travel to sent it back. Very disappointed,4

More acne, causes purging, gave me permanent scars and acne",1,"It made me breakout like crazy after 10 days of using it, gave me cystic acne. Kept using it because it said it just purges the skin but I was wrong, I should have stopped. Now my skin is full of acne and permanent dark spots 6 months later. Definitely don’t buy. Worst acne cleanser I have bought my whole life.",3

Didn’t work for my skin",1,I have combo oily skin that gets dry depending on the season. I do feel like it helped with the oil build up but it dried out my face too much. I went with the hydrating cream to foam by CeraVee and that’s been the winner.,0

... years ago after the nurse at my dermatologists office recommended it. For the first few months",1,"Started using this product about 3 1/2 years ago after the nurse at my dermatologists office recommended it. For the first few months, it was fine. It dried me out a bit, but I was oily so that was more a benefit than anything else. Then, about 6 months after starting it, I ended up with these painful rashes on my eyelids. My dermatologist thought it was my nail polish, as I had just started wearing it again after a long break. Stopped the nail polish, got medicine for eyelids, things got better but never completely better. I went through constant cycles of rash-scaly skin-flakes on my eyelids for the next couple of years. I couldn't wear makeup because it was painful and looked awful. Meanwhile, I started getting the same rash on my scalp, ears, and under my skin. After some product elimination (but not my face wash because he thought I was using cetaphil like he suggested), we decided it was just the dry, sometimes windy and hot, weather. So for the next two years I dealt with it. The whole thing was actually pretty embarrassing because random flakes of skin would just fall off at random, usually when I was having a conversation.About 6 months ago I read a review on another site that listed symptoms just like mine, so I followed my dermatologist's original advice and switched to cetaphil. The rash disappeared in only a couple days.It seems like a lot of people like this product, and that's great, but if you're having problems like mine it might be due to the cerave.",272

Face Wash",1,"Do not recommend buying face wash on Amazon.

Not Good for Sensitive Skin :(",1,"I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that I'm allergic to something in CeraVe products. I've tried several products over the years, and it never ends well for my skin.When I first started using this, it was great: no strong fragrances and got my face clean. Within a week though, I had a TERRIBLE breakout issue. I had whiteheads all along my lower jaw and cheeks, to the point where it was painful and itchy. It looked like a bad allergic reaction. It cleared up after about a week of me not using the product luckily, but it wasn't a fun time. I saw some people online saying that they're actually allergic to the niacinamide in skincare products, and I'm wondering if that's the case for me too; since switching to products without that ingredient, my skin has cleared up significantly.Overall, I think it's more of my skin's fault than the product's, but I still wanted to warn people like me with sensitive skin about my experience.",10

there’s no way these reviews are serious",1,"I bought this because I’ve had really oily skin for the summer. My face had finally cleared up after several visits to the dermatologist and using a different cleanser so I decided it couldn’t hurt to try this product since I’ve heard nothing but good things about CeraVe. First of all, I should’ve known this cleanser would be terrible as soon as I tried it because it smells horrible; it has this awful chemical smell that I knew I shouldn’t have trusted (but I did because I’ve never used any CeraVe product before). I also wanted to wait a while after using this cleanser to post a review, but it’s only been a month and it has absolutely ruined my face. Maybe that’s not long enough time for my face to get used to the product or something but I honestly can’t continue using it after comparing how bad my acne is now to how clear my face was using cheaper products a month ago. Maybe it works for some, but this was not the product for me. It also didn’t even help with the oily skin problem lol. It definitely got worse within the month.",2

Caused reaction- proceed with caution.",1,Bought this for my child to use as a face wash to help with small breakout in her T-Zone area. It caused an allergic reaction all over her face. She had red irritated patches on her cheeks and jawline and clear lines of demarcation across her face. Took her to the doctor to make sure it wasn’t a rash or infectious process of some sort to be extra cautious. After checking her over and then going over anything she was exposed to the doctor was pretty convinced it was the face wash as the culprit. She had to take some antihistamines and some anti inflammatory meds and put hydrocortisone cream on the patches for a few days and simply wash her face with warm water to let it rest and help it heal. I’m sure a lot of people use this product with no issue but I would strongly suggest a skin patch test for a couple of days before using on your entire face.,10

Slimey",1,"So, you know that slime you make when you mix together borax and glue? Well, that's what it feels like when you put this on your face. There's nothing ""foaming"" about it. It feels like slime and gunky and, frankly, like school glue- it's that sticky. I've been using it for the past two weeks, hoping things would change. I've tried it in the shower, at the sink, even in different states (cause maybe it was the water I was using that made it so odd). But nothing changed. I have to SCRUB this stuff off and it makes my skin feel like I just did a craft project with tweens and then rubbed it all over my face. Maybe that's the whole point- to make my skin feel so dirty that I feel like I need to wash it with a different product, thus cleaning my face twice. I'm not sure if that was the plan for this product, but that is the only logical explanation I can think of as to why they would create this product. I've been using it for about a week and haven't noticed any differences in my skin (good or bad). Sorry, this stuff just isn't worth it at all- I'd rather rub craft glue on myself and peel it off. At least that's entertaining!",6

Parabens should be banned in the U. S.",1,I didn’t check the ingredients before buying CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser because I thought CeraVe was known to be a “clean ” brand. This product has two parabens in its ingredients list. Back it goes. I won’t make that mistake again. I had been paraben-free for 15 years! CeraVe is WAY behind the times.,2

IF YOURE BREAKING OUT PLEASE READ",1,"I’m writing this review to hopefully save someone else from this!! While I don’t think CeraVe is a bad brand it did not work for me and actually caused horrible break outs. When I started using this product I also begin using a few other new products as well. My skin begin to breakout like never before (I usually only get a pimple every once in awhile) I changed my diet, cut out certain products, started taking probiotics, and did almost everything else not knowing what was wrong. Finally 3 months and many many pimples and scars later I cut out the cerave cleanser and went back to my basic face wash. Within 2 days my pimples were gone. PLEASE if you started using this product and are breaking out stop using this!  I wish I had known sooner and saved my skin the scars and trauma.",11

Not paraben free",1,"I don’t understand how these brand name companies are still putting parabens in their products. So buy something else? Well, as of the time that I am writing this review, the title of the face wash distinctly says paraben free. But the bottle clearly states methylparaben and propylparaben in the ingredient list. So I don’t like deceptive marketing.",3

Never going back!",1,"Edit: lol I had a severe allergic reaction two years later, so who knows. I use CetaPhil now and it’s been going well!I was recommended this by my sister who has fairly sensitive skin like me. I have eczema around my eyes that does NOT react well to certain products, so I did my research and read a LOT of reviews. I found the most negatives tended to say that it didn't actually foam up, that it had a distinct, nasty smell, and that it dried their skin out.I am not positive which product those people may have received, because this cleanser was absolutely amazing! For those saying it didn't foam, my suggestion would be getting your hands wet, pumping one or two pumps, then rubbing your hands together before lathering it on your face. It foams up pretty fast, but not in an overpowering manner. I didn't notice any unusual scent, it just smelled like every other cleanser. I wouldn't say it dries out your skin, but it does leave it feeling very tight. I typically use Pond's moisturizer after cleaning my face.Overall, it is a wonderful product that gets the job done! Very gentle for my sensitive skin!",2

Inconsistent Products",1,"I have been using this product for a year now, and normally it is pretty good. My skin does not require too many products and I am not too picky about what I use as face wash. In the past, I have used anything from soap bars to body wash to wash my face, without any irritation. However, the most recent time I bought this product, when I started using it my eyelids began to develop a severe rash. But, I have been using this product for a long time already without any problem so I did not think it was that. This continued on for a month until I realized it was the face wash, at which point I stopped using it but my eyelids had already been irritated for so long they are still healing. I don't know what they put in this specific bottle this time but it is really frustrating that there was suddenly a problem. Just be careful with this product, even if you are a returning customer.",3

I LOVE the cerave lotion tub, so I expected I’d love this...",1,"I’m obsessed with the Cerave moisturizing lotion, that comes in the blue lid tub. From the second I put it on my body and face I was in love. And when I saw this I thought it would be just as amazing coming from the Cerave brand as well.I was sadly mistaken. I have semi-dry skin that is tough as nails. By that I mean it takes a lot for me to have a more than my hormonal chin blemish here and there. I don’t get oily, dry patches or peely skin.After using this for 3 days I broke out on my forehead and cheek. I was covered (and still am) in tiny little bumps on my forehead, between my eyebrows and temples. I’m extremely oily in some places and dry (and flaking) in others. This stuff disrupted my not even close to sensitive skin. So disappointed that it didn’t deliver. 😕",21

Excessively dried out the skin and broke me out.",1,"It was big mistake to switch from cetaphil ! the worst face wash I have used ! It says it is recommended by dermatologists but honestly no dermatologist I have seen till date, ever recommended me using anything apart from cetaphil. My skin condition got better(had zero pimples for the longest time) and I was bored using cetaphil for ages hence wanted to try something new. Perhaps that was the worst mistake of my life. This face wash dried my skin excessively, broke me out(I have regularly 3-4 acne now) and I had to switch to OTC medicines(which again did not work and worsened my condition) for the pimples. Threw away almost more than half the bottle because its a big pack and won't just finish. Now I am back to using cetaphil, things are definitely looking better.N.B: I do not use any other cosmetics (gel or moisturizer) on my skin.",7

You can guess the result. Super dry skin resulting in more oil and breakouts. I only gave this a try because so many seem to swear by it, but knew I made a mistake after a couple of days. I mean my skin doesn't dry too easily given the oily nature, but even with a moisturizer, my skin felt tighter than a snare drum. Do yourself a favor and buy products that are paraben and detergent free. Treat your face with cheap stuff and you'll get what you pay for. Hard pass on this.",3

SUPER Painful Breakouts—Patch Test First!!!",1,"I have never had such a painful breakout like the one I experienced after using this cleanser. I thought the people complaining of breakouts must have very sensitive skin as I have never had an issue with ANY cleanser, but this one HURT! I’m worried it may have actually left some scarring too but I hope it fades with time. It took a little while to figure out it was the cleanser because I (stupidly) tried a new night cream and primer at the same time, but every time I have used this cleanser, I get patches of very painful breakouts that last for days afterward. Thankfully I have a good natural toner that took away some of the pain, but I will NEVER use this cleanser again. It’s a shame I wasted $15 that could have been used elsewhere.",5

NOT worth the HYPE.",1,"For the hype this product has been getting lately.... I hated it. I had A FEW breakouts right before my period would start obviously because of hormones. Wanted to try this because it was supposedly not as harsh at the face wash I was using. My face has NEVER, not even in high school, been broke out as bad as it is now. Huge painful acne all over my chin and some on my cheeks. And on top of that I have recently stopped wearing makeup all day while at work so you’d think my skin would be even healthier. No. Used the whole bottle (just to make sure it wasn’t break outs in the beginning from switching face wash) just kept getting worse and worse. Will NEVER use this again.",3

First 1-2 weeks of using this one, and my face broke out like no tomorrow.. my face was SOO oily within the next 2-3 hours, like more than normal. I had to have wipes and napkins on stand by… threw it away and went to get a new one from ulta, worked perfectly fine.",0

Burned and Caused Acne",1,"I have never had an issue with a facial cleanser before, but this product started making my skin super irritated and stung a lot after the first couple of uses. Initially it was fine, but after not too long it burned every time I tried to use it and I noticed I started to have a lot more smaller acne and irritated red skin than usual. After I stopped using it my skin has gradually gone back to normal. I had heard good things so I was pretty disappointed, especially since the bottle is so huge and I used hardly any of it.",0

Not worth buying if you have sensitive skin",1,"Made my face really bumpy, gave me more pimples, and made my face very dry and itchy. (I also used the CeraVe lotion with this on my face) Will not recommend to people with sensitive skin. I used it after watching DrDray on YouTube and thought I’d give it a go. But it really is not worth it. I regret trying it. I used it for a little over a week. Now I am having trouble fixing what it did to my face. I’ve never had such a bad acne problem on my face until now. My forehead was hit the worse. So bumpy. And my skin on my face often is red now.",13

Totally wrong.Amazon asks me to rate this product based on moisturizing, scent and for sensitive skin.

Cystic Acne Sufferers Beware",1,"I wanted to love this stuff after rave reviews for oily skin sufferers like me. Sadly this is a nightmare in a bottle if you get cystic acne. In a matter of a week and a half, my face has blown up. I can see at least 4 cysts forming already just in the past 2 days. I usually get only one or two at a time, usually within a month.

I’ve always gotten a pimple here or there but never more than one or two at a time. After three months of use my skin has never looked worse with cystic acne EVERYWHERE!

I have tried every product on the market for acne and this is by far the worst. I have never had a product make my face break out that badly that fast. I know that it was not an allergic reaction, because I am not allergic to anything. It does not foam and is really thick and does not go on easily in the least. The bottle is also a lot smaller than what I was thinking it would be. On top of all that it is really overpriced. I am going to go back to using nutragena.

I liked it at first, but within a few days I started getting whiteheads and tiny bumps all over my face. I already have mild to moderate acne so I don't need more. As soon as I switched back to Philosophy Purity, my acne improved overnight and within a few days all of my pimples were gone. This cleanser also made my face slightly drier than Purity. It left a slippery film on my face which clogged my pores. One good thing is that it never made my face itch. I'm not saying this is a bad cleanser.  It has good ingredients. It might work for some people, but didn't work for me.",26

I read many of the reviews and saw that this product was given mostly 5 out of 5 so I was pretty optimistic. However, after about almost two weeks of using the product, I noticed a huge change in my skin. Never in my entire life of using cleansers have I ever had so many breakouts caused by it.

It feels great when I wash my skin with it, but immediately after washing my face become so dry and flaky and looks absolutely terrible. I've been using a different medicated face wash for acne and it really dried my skin, so I was looking for a more gentle cleanser. This product, however, was more harsh on my skin than the medicated acne wash. Beware before buying this product that this could also happen to you.

I pick up this face wash to notice it was not completely closed or sealed shut. I had to clean the product off of everything I ordered. And to get a replacement I have to send the face wash back. Dealing with that mess and sending it back does not seem worth all the trouble.,2

Contains At Least 6 HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS",1,"I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks now & have been having 1 or 2 big pimples the whole time. Yesterday I woke up with a third and these are sore & red.  I never have this kind of acne so I googled ""harmful ingredients is facial cleanser "" and found an article listing many of the ingredients found in this cleanser. Here's a link if interested.http://www.collective-evolution.com/2012/04/10/you-have-the-right-to-know-17-chemicals-to-avoid-in-cosmetic-and-personal-care-products/ I slathered some raw honey all over my face to sooth the soreness. It's awful how companies put so many harmful toxic & carcinogenic substances in their products & then say it ""helps restore and maintain"".  What a bunch of lies!",8

This is my first negative review and I’m using it ...",1,This is my first negative review and I’m using it on this product. I bought it to use as a daily face wash because every now and then I get a couple pimples. This face wash made my face break out with a red bumpy rash. I have never looked at my skin as sensitive so it came as a surprise. My advice stick to a face wash that u have used in the past. This one is going in the trash I’m mad I spent money on this😩,8

CAN CAUSE ACNE",1,I’ve never had completely clear skin but usually there’s only a blemish or two at a time. This product made my entire chin and jawline break out. I used it for over a full week in case it was “clearing out” my skinny and actually working. There was more acne every day and the day I stopped using it I stopped getting new acne. WATCH OUT if acne begins when you start using this,2
