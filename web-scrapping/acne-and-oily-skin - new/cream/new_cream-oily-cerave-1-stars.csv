Irritates sensitive skin",1.0,"I bought this along with CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser and CeraVe Retinol Serum for Post-Acne Marks and Skin Texture. I LOVE the retinol but the cleanser and acne treatment made my skin turn sensitive, red, and flaky after about a month of use. My acne seemed unchanged. I finally stopped using the acne gel and cleanser and just use raw honey and the CeraVe retinol. I still have acne but at least my face is not burning anymore. Do NOT recommend it for people who actually have really sensitive skin.",0
