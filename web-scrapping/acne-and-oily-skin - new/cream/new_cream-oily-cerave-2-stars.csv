Not for me.",2.0,"Sticky sticky sticky!!! Took all day to dry. I only used a tiny bit and at bedtime it was still trying to stick to the pillowcase. I rewashed my face and haven't used it since. The other reviews seem to be happy with it but mine is going in the trash. I can't afford to waste money so this was a real disappointment. I swear, I could have stuck a piece of paper on my forehead and it would have stayed there all day. I didn't know such a tiny bit could turn my face into a post it.",3

I’m better off without it",2.0,I would use this product anywhere from once every two days to twice a day after washing and moisturizing my face. It ultimately always made me break out and did nothing to resolve existing blackheads.,0

Average acne cream",2.0,I used this cream every night to help with my acne but it didn't do anything for me. It didn't make my skin worse but it didn't make it better either; didn't have any affect at all and still experienced regular acne.,0
