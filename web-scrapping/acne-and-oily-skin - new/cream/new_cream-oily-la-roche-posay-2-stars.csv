Burned my face",2,"So, I might have used it wrong but it burned my face. This product is very strong. However, I used it like a moisturizer. (Washed my face at night, applied this all over my face, applied moisturizer). All using La Roche products as well. I think this is only meant to be used when you have a big pimple on your face you want to dry out. DO NOT USE THIS ALL OVER YOUR FACE. It hurt so bad I had to put honey all over my face to ease the burning sensation even after rinsing it off. Not sure if this is safe for sensitive skin. I don’t think ill be using this for a while.",0

Didn’t work for me:(",2,"I love a lot of la Roche Posay products, especially the effaclar series but this product was terrible for my skin. I’ve tried everything but it made my skin break out so bad and gave me a lot of scarring. Be careful and if it doesn’t work don’t try to give it more chances. I’m really sad it didn’t work out for me but every skin reacts different",0

good but caused my face to be swollen",2,"i can tell this stuff clears up my skin, but the next morning after trying it for the second time, my face was red and swollen! Maybe i used to much so i’m gonna try it again in a couple of days as more of a spot treatment.",0

Not for dry/normal skin",2,"This was incredibly drying and harsh to my skin even with just one application. I don’t know how oily skin would take it, but I don’t think you should be trying to dry out your skin which this does wayyy too much. Caused a little peeling too",0

Give it 2 stars doesn't necessarily mean it's bad",2,"I really don't have idea on whether it's a good product or not a good product. I applied it to my skin and I felt burned after a few minutes. I didn't take that serious because I guessed it might the way how it is, maybe it just how this product worked. And this morning, I looked up the mirror and found some red spots on my skin, not very red, but pretty much like sunburn. Maybe it worked, but I really don't like things it left on my skin. I decided to quit and feel like maybe aloe gel is better than that. I mean not better than ""treating acnes"", but better than ""calming skin.""Actually I am also worried—I am afraid this product has damaged my skin. I searched the comments here and found people who have similar situation with me. They either want to quit also or they will continue with what they are doing. But for me, I am going to give up. I don't want to treat my acne with the risk of damaging my skin. I still believe it's a good product since it is sold by Amazon. I believe Amazon. I won't use this product anymore. I have to take best care of my skin. People who want to purchase this product consider it twice. Maybe it's a good product, but it just doesn't work for me.",2

Wasn’t effective for me",2,I wanted this product to work so much… but…I bought this product for mild acne that I develop during my monthly cycle. I have been using it with my skincare routine 2x/day for more than a week now for just some spot treatments. Did not do much to clear the pimples up. It is definitely good for those who have sensitive skin because of its creamy and non-drying formula. I will stick to a serum with a higher percentage next time.,2

Didn't work for me, may have made acne worse or just longer-lasting",2,"I was looking for an prescription-free alternative to my 1% clyndamycin/5% benzoyl peroxide medication and stumbled across a study that said that this product was proven to be just as effective (the study didn't name this product at all, but I was able to all but confirm this was the case later). So, heck, I went ahead and bought this, even though it's pricier than I'd like.I really hate to leave negative reviews or vibes of any kind, but this....just didn't work. I used it repeatedly for several days only to find that the acne I applied it over simply didn't improve or respond at all to the active ingredients--and I swear it may have even made the duration of said acne last longer than it normally would. It's sitting in my medicine cabinet right now and I'm considering asking for a refund. Hope it works better for all of you reading this!",4

Skin Reaction",2,"I use other effaclar products and enjoy them- my skin tolerates them well. This product left me with a terrible reaction on the areas in which i applied it- it felt like a sunburn, was very scaly, dry, itchy, and caused small pustules. Definitely does not work for me.",2

Sadly, cannot recommend",2,"I tried this product because I have been using a 10% benzoyl peroxide cream, which has kept my acne under control but is causing some dryness. Sadly, this product has been less effective and has major afterburner... about 30 minutes after I apply, my face burns uncomfortably for about an hour. Benzoyl peroxide can be irritating, but I do not experience this level of irritation with my 10% benzoyl peroxide cream, so I am assuming it is the other ingredients causing additional irritation. I gave it time, but two weeks of use have not improved my tolerance. I have gone back to my 10% and am just mixing it with a good moisturizer, and this is much better.",3

Too strong! Had terrible allergic reaction.",2,"I loved the Effaclar K but wanted to try something different and ended up ordering this with a few other products (moisturizer & toner from another brand). I didn't break out suddenly, but developed a terrible allergic reaction gradually which made my cheek look like I had been slapped hard. Not the whole face, but my right side cheek...had turned deep red. My sister actually asked me if someone had hit me. I immediately sent a picture to my friend's mother who is a dermatologist and she told me the most plausible culprit is the Effaclar Duo, so I cut it out and applied steroid-based ointments sparingly. Skin returned to normal in a few days. I do have sensitive skin, but never had such strong reaction to something. Even if you're mildly sensitive I want to warn you not to take risks with this product and try the Effaclar K first.",4

The thing that drew me in was that big allure magazine seal of approval, I purchased the product hoping for the miracle product to help reduce my acne,but boy was i completely wrong! Just a little background on my skin type, I have normal to oily acne prone skin. I also tested out this product for 2 consecutive weeks, the results.....The GOOD:-Packaging of the productThe BAD-Dried out my skin-Made my skin very itchy-Brought up little bumps-Enlarged my nose poresThe UGLY--Cost-MADE ME BREAK OUT MORE!!**Overall not happy with the results at all, I don't know if its because of the weather or the climate change, but during this winter this product is a complete no go.

Too Harsh for Sensitive Skin",2,"This was HORRIBLY irritating to my sensitive skin.  I have battled blackheads on my nose since I can remember and thought that this might help me.  But, it was just WAY too harsh.  I didn't use it more than a couple of days before I had to give up since my nose was just burning and no improvement was seen.  (Previously I was using Effaclar K, which was okay, but not great.  My pores did look smaller with this, but I couldn't use this lotion under my daily moisturizer/sunscreen, it would create little while ""balls."")",3

It was also slightly red.  I have used the product before and I never had this reaction.  I am wondering if my skin has changed as I have aged.  Unfortunately the acne has remained.  I am going to try to use it sparingly and see if it works.  But if you have sensitive skin - don't use.,6

I was told anything after 14 days is no longer a skin ""purge"" so this product did cause me to breakout. I didn't find it irritating but did not like the boils that popped up all over my face.",0

Bad for sensitive skin",2,"This was really rough on my sensitive skin. It would be okay on the body or on the jawline or hairline, but when I put it on breakouts around my nose, mouth, or cheeks, it burned like crazy. I'm used to acne products having a bit of a burn so I left it for 45 minutes or so, but it never stopped burning. I finally washed it off, and my face still burns. Can't speak to its effectiveness since I couldn't leave it on long enough to see any results, threw it out. I was already worried about its potential to bleach clothes/towels/sheets, so it's not worth it for me to use it elsewhere.",0

Make a patch test before applying it more broadly.",2,"I recently decided to give this acne treatment cream another try, as I had a positive experience with it a few years ago. Unfortunately, this time around, the results were far from what I expected.The product claims to be safe for sensitive skin, but my experience was quite the opposite. After using it, not only did I experience breakouts, but my skin also became irritated and felt burnt. It was quite disappointing, especially considering my previous success with this cream.This acne treatment cream might still be effective for some, as it was for me in the past. However, it's crucial to be cautious if you have sensitive skin and conduct a patch test before applying it more broadly. Unfortunately, this time, my experience was far from satisfactory.",2
