Smooth, not tacky",3.0,"Glides on beautifully, absorbs easily, does not feel greasy. I'm 52 and live in Utah where we have the dry, desert heat of summer and the drying heat of indoor heaters during the winter. My skin gets super dry.The issue, for me, are clogged pores that I did not have before using this. I have had two largish blemishes develop while everything else seems to be enlarged pores, developing blackheads and some whiteheads. I've given this product a few weeks to see if the issue is my skin simply adjusting to a new product, and I'll continue to give it a few more, but I didn't have this issue with a product I've used for over 20 years that I've had difficulty finding in store or online. I've also noticed that my face always eems to be slightly red and splotchy in places, kind of like a blush.Overall, this product is one I REALLY want to like and continue using, but only time will tell if the enlarged and clogged pores are a result of the product or my skin adjusting.",6

Gentle but not good for dry skin",3.0,"I ordered the face wash and moisturizer combo to try while my nose area is recovering from perioral dermatitis, opting for some gentler products. I have combination skin which is currently pretty dry as winter sets in, and the moisturizer just doesn't cut it. The cleanser is nice and gentle but I need to use an oil cleanser beforehand to get my makeup off (and I only wear a thin skin tint, nothing major). Additionally, the pores on my nose are newly clogged after switching to these products. After a week of using these my skin is dry and flaky in some areas, so unfortunately they're getting shelved - however, I think they'll be good to use after my chemical peels. I think this brand makes quality products but these weren't the best for my skin type, but may work better for those whk do not have dry skin.",0

Not what I expected",3.0,"I purchased the product for use on my face.  I have used it for three days.  It goes on well but my skin dries  back up shortly after applying.  For the price that I paid, I that feel that I wasted my money.  Coconut oil has worked betterThen again, maybe it will take longer that e days  for me to see results",0

Wanted to love it",3.0,"The pilling was too much for me.  It didn't pill with every use, and I couldn't figure out why.

A little heavier than I was expecting & stings your eyes",3.0,"I have fair, combination skin and was looking for a 2 in 1 so I didn't have to buy two products and I could save a step in the morning. This moisturizer is a bit heavier than I was hoping for. It would probably be great for dry skin or in the winter. A little goes a long way, like a dime/nickle size for your face would be plenty. When I put it on I thought it would dry down, but it pretty much stayed moderately shiny. It doesn't absorb very much. It doesn't make me a total greaseball but with my already combination skin, I don't need any extra shine. I'm hoping it will do better in the fall/winter when my skin gets drier. It does sting your eyes too, so be careful. It took me a couple times to realize what it was because I didn't realize I was getting it too close to the corner of my eye.",5

Dry",3.0,"So far so amazing! All these years I've been using moisturizer for oily skin. Decided to try something new as my last moisturizer was not comfortable on my skin.This immediately felt soothing to my skin, no stinging, no redness, my face so far has stayed matte after application which is HUGE. First time in my skin conscious life I haven't had an oily gross face after about an hour in the morning.I don't love the bottle, the cap is a little difficult to open and I have a hard time getting a controlled amount of product out.*****Update, my face has been consistently super dry by mid day, huge flakey dry patches. So bummed. Idk why this would be so drying. My face feels really tight and uncomfortable after about an hour like it needs a good moisturizer.So bummed. I love how matte is makes me but can't do the dryness.",2

Not sure if this is really authentic LaRoche",3.0,"So, Ive been using this for 3 months. I've had the pilling and it doesn't really seem like it moisturizes much. I will completely exfoliate and use my Pixi glycolic acid peels and then use this moisturizer. So the whole exfoliate well before applying doesn't even work. As far as scent there isn't one, which is good. It doesn't feel like lotion more like thick water. It also doesn't irritate my overly sensitive skin.Here is where the I don't think it's real comes in.A week ago my husband placed a pick up order for Walgreens. They placed some samples in the bag and he came home with them. One of the samples was this product.I grabbed it and said thanks. The next day I forgot to put my moisturizer on upstairs. So I grabbed the little sample on the table (feeling lazy and didn't want to climb a flight of stairs) and applied it in the downstairs half bath. I noticed right away that the consistency wasn't the same. The sample was more creamy. The more I put it on the more I was like wait, huh. So I ran upstairs and grabbed my big bottle.I pulled the cap off and told my husband they don't smell the same. My bottle from Amazon had a slightly underlying fragrance smell, nothing strong just a minute amount. The sample did not. My Amazon bottle pills almost constantly. The Walgreens sample did not...AT ALL!!! The Amazon one had a watery feel. The sample one was creamy and went on nicely and kept my face moisturized all day. The Amazon one I was reapplying multiple times a day.My husband asked me where I got the big bottle and I stated Amazon. He said maybe it's not right or it's old stock. Whichever it is I prefer the sample and will be getting it from Walgreens since it's the same price as here.",29

Perfect for oily, sensitive types and damaged skin barrier BUT pills if you don't know how to use it",3.0,"Don't get me wrong: it'll never break you out, it'll repair your skin barrier, and fade hyperpigmentation to even out your skin tone but it barely moisturizes since I have extremely dry skin and it pills a lot (creates crumbs on your face). You need to apply it on damp skin and rub it in extremely well, or apply it right after something wet like a serum or aloe vera in order for it to not pill. You could also just use it as a dedicated nighttime moisturizer if you don't want to risk someone seeing you pill at all.It'd be perfect for someone with an oily, sensitive skin type and they would not have much issue like I did. Where you live also depends because in tropical humid climates like Singapore, Mexico, or the Philippines, it absorbed into my skin easily and never pilled but the second I moved to a cold, dry climate in California, it pilled like crazy and didn't moisturize enough.If La Roche Posay changed the formulation to make it absorb better and never pill (or maybe added more moisture with hyaluronic acid/panthenol), this would probably be the best moisturizer on the market.",21

It would be perfect if it didn't peel",3.0,"This is an ok cream overall. It is moisturizing, and I also like that it's odorless. La Roche-Posay is a good brand. However, there is something that bothers me a lot: it leaves a lot of residue that peels. Sometimes, in the middle of the day, I look in the mirror, and it looks like my skin is peeling, but it's actually the moisturizer. If I put the moisturizer on my forehead and the peels fall into my eyes, it makes my eyes itchy and dry. I had to change to another moisturizer to avoid this annoying residue.",0

I feel some level of moisture. The packaging is good.  Squeeze tube with a flip cap.The bad:It pills all over your face which causes you to wipe the product off to get rid of the pilling.  I ended up using a clean/damp make-up sponge to flick the pilling away without rubbing the product off my face and further irritating my skin.It did nothing to calm down my eyelids.

Moisturizing but pills badly",3.0,"I REALLY wanted to love this stuff -  it feels nice on my sensitive skin, is extremely moisturizing and fragrance-free, isn't too thick or too thin, and then some - but it pills quite a bit if you're heavy-handed with face creams. I traditionally use an SPF moisturizer in the morning and a regular moisturizer before bed, and after washing my face, all I use is The Ordinary Squalene with Retinol and whatever night cream I currently have. I know the pilling comes from this product because I've used it without retinol and have had the same pilling issue, too. Aside from this, it's a wonderful product! I would only recommend purchasing this if you're going to use no more than a pea-sized amount. I know this is a highly-enjoyed product, but it sadly didn't work for me and my skincare routine.",3

Bad for my sensitive skin",3.0,"I've bought this product twice. Once for my SO and once for me. My SO has acne prone oily skin that is not sensitive at all and this product made his face very soft and cleared his complexion a bit. No acne flareups either. He loves it. I have somewhat sensitive skin that is prone to redness and hormonal acne. The second I put this lotion on my face it started burning intensely. Everywhere it touched. It felt like one of those face washes with salicylic acid that I used as a preteen. My skin still burns even after washing it off. Disappointing since their website said it would be good for sensitive skin. I've also used their cream cleanser and sunscreen and neither irritated my skin, so I hadn't really expected this to. Oh well. At least I have someone to give this to.",6

Kinda Grainy.",3.0,"I've enjoyed this brand's products in the past, so thought this would be a good purchase.  Not sure if my bottle of lotion was expired or if the product is just typically like this, but the texture felt gritty/grainy and not incredibly smooth going on tender facial skin.  The texture just wasn't pleasant at all.  The smell is fine, the amount in bottle (for the price) was a good value, and the brand is typically good.  But, this one is a hard pass for me due to the unpleasantly sandy feel on sensitive skin.  This is not the sunscreen formulation, so I expected a better texture.  Now I wish I would have just purchased the SPF version so I could maybe chalk the gritty feeling up to SPF chemicals, or something.",0

Should’ve listened to the reviews — YES this piles",3.0,This moisturizer is ok if you use it on of something like a serum. On it’s own it doesn’t feel that moisturizing. I saw all the reviews saying that it is “pilling” .. aka balls up when you rub it into your skin. I still bought it anyway thinking they probably didn’t clean their face well enough and lo and behold it started pilling! Also burned a little the first time I put it on. This is something I can’t wear outside so I will just stick to using it at night after my tret routine. I will go back to my hydroboost water gel and stratia liquid gold once this is finished though.,3
