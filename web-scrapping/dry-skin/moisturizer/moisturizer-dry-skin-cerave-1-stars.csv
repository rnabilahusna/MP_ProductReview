This product is great, but the package is terrible.",1.0,"I like the product, but when I first used the pump to get lotion out of the packaging, the pump broke! I had to screw off the cap with the broken pump, then I shook some lotion out of the container to apply. What a hassle (I bought the pump to make access easier).I wrote to the company telling them about the problem. They asked a bunch of questions (what is the exact product, when did I buy it, where did I buy it, how much did I pay for it), and after answering every question, their reply was basically “sorry, there’s nothing we can do.”!I became very disappointed with the company even though I liked their product. I just wish their customer service would have been as good as their product (minus the defective packaging).",3

Not good quality",1.0,I tried something new and this is not good quality. A few hours later I’m ashy like I never put anything on! I normally use goldbond. Going back to why I know. This product is soooo watery. I should have known. I even tried to put coconut oil on top of it and that didn’t help either.,0

This product is straight up bad",1.0,I am the kind of person who reads a lot of reviews and does her research before buying a product. However watching so many dermatologists vouching for this moisturizer I caved in. I just read some reviewa and most were positive. It didn't work for me.there were other products I was using along with it so I had to do a lot of permutations to weed out the bad ones. I also use two apps now that score products. I highly recommend yuca and skin bliss to you. I am not going to talk more about the apps. They however showed me how some of these endorsed products did not work for someone with my complex skin type and then further showed me how terrible they are to begin with.do what you must with this info. It has nothing to do with the seller btw. The product is just bad.lots of ingredients that are bad. You will be so shocked to find how many products we use daily are affecting us int he long run and am not just saying breakouts and what not but cancer causing.,16

(Best lotion I’ve ever used!) WAS until L’Oreal changed the formula...",1.0,"Already reviewed, but I’ll add to: this is a completely amazing lotion. I like it so much I did subscribe and save. This has given me baby-soft, silky skin, all over. Superb stuff!!An UPDATE and WARNING:Apparently CeraVe was bought by L’Oreal, and as with all good things ruined by conglomerates, the formula has been changed. The last big bottle I got through Amazon S&S was the old formula I loved so much. I bought a tiny bottle for my bag, and noticed it wasn’t the same, it’s more of a gel now and doesn’t work nearly as well. Then I looked at the ingredient labels! Some reshuffling, which means some stuff that was already there was increased, some stuff was decreased (namely, the ceramides), and some garbage was added, which makes me fairly angry. WHY do these huge companies wreck good things for the customers who love a product? So...through no fault of Amazon, I cancelled my S&S and will start the long and expensive slog of trying to find a lotion that works.",43

I am just upset that some of the product I paid for was wasted and wish my only option wasn’t to have to send the whole bottle back to be compensated for it — I need what remains of the product now and I can’t wait for a full replacement.

Expired lotion??",1.0,"The lotion smelled horrible on my skin like it had been expired or old. I am aware that cerave has a fragrance but this smelled different, like how old makeup smells. When I first got it and took it out of the packaging, it had a green greasy stain on the bottle but I thought nothing of it at the time. I even tried using it for a few days but even my boyfriend noticed the smell when I asked him to try it out. Very disappointed.",0

Not for me",1.0,"I purchased this lotion after reading rave reviews and being pleased with the price. Unfortunately, this lotion doesn't work for my skin. I have pretty average skin - not oily and not dry. It isn't flawless, but I don't have any major issues either. I had been using Cetaphil face cream and wanted to try something new. I paired this with the foaming facial cleanser. I stopped using the cleanser after only a day or two because I immediately noticed my skin was parched after using it. Wanting to see if this lotion would work, I began using my VaniCream facial bar soap again and this lotion at night. (I use Eucerin SPF 30 face lotion during the day). After 2+ weeks, I'm not impressed. My face is constantly breaking out (plus taking extremely long to heal) and he skin on my nose is super dry. Since everyone's skin is so different, I'm sure this works wonders for others. Unfortunately, not for me.",4

Lipid-like maybe? I’m not sure if it sat too long somewhere, got too hot or too cold in transit or the warehouse or what but it’s pretty fragrant and a little off-putting, and I’m not the only one who could smell it.",2

BEWARE--- Contains PARABENS",1.0,"Parabens have been known to be ""endocrine disrupters"" for several years now.  Parabens seep through the skin, into your system, and can harm metabolic and developmental processes, especially in the young.,  They are suspected contributers to chronic diseases.  Many companies that manufacture products we use for our bodies-- shampoos, creams, lotions-- have banned the use of Parabens in their products, and proudly advertise that they do that.  I did not realize, unfortunately, that this company still use PARABENS.  BAD for your health!  It is cheaper for companies to use this than other types of fillers and 'preservatives'.  Your potential bad health is the trade-off.",6
