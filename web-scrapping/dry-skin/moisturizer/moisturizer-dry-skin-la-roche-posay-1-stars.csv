Pills badly!",1.0,"This is still not moisturizing enough for me on my face.  And I noticed it makes some pilling when I try to put on make up.  Finally I decided just to use it up on my body.  After showering I put it on my body.  I sat down and was crossing my legs while watching TV.  I felt something gritty and kept rubbing my legs to get it off - not paying much attention since I was watching TV.  When a commercial break came, I looked at my legs and saw pilling and it had even gone on the floor.  I just vacuumed this morning and then did errands and was gone most of the day and so I am certain the pilling is from this moisturizer.  Now I know what that gritty, sandy feeling was last night on my bed sheets, too.  I‚Äôll need to rewash the bedding, remake the bed, and vacuum the trail of pilling off the floor.  Not only is this not moisturizing enough, it also pills and makes a mess.  Would not recommend, especially for the price.",0

So stinky it burns",1.0,I have been on a sunscreen hunt for years. The answer is EltaMD. This is oily. They all are. (Except EltaMD which dries matte). What these creators don't understand is that oily sunscreen slides off your face and takes your make up with it. I had a burned nose by the end of the day. And I always look wrecked because it took my make up with it. Bummer! The smell is so strong and it WILL burn your eyes. I'm tired of being an oil slick. Move on.,0

Dried up and irritated my skin",1.0,"I ordered this lotion to help hydrate my face from the dry winer. I used this lotion 2 times and it completely dried up and irritated my skin. I could not use any lotions on my face as it felt raw, was red, and lotions stung. Ihad to order aloe vera and to apply to my face. My skin is starting to look normal again and am back to using my original lotion on my face.",0

Definitely not for Sensitive Skin",1.0,I bought this product because it claims helps with rosacea & dryness. Once I put a small pea amount on my freshly clean face I immediately started to feel burning & itchiness. So I told myself maybe that because my skin is a bit too dry. So next day my face was like a tomato üôÑ üòí  it worst than before now. Definitely don't recommend on sensitive Rosacea skin.,0

Caused Break out!!",1.0,"Used the product three times on my face and my whole face is covered in bumps now.After applying the product, it makes little crumbs on the skin. I've never had a face cream do that.I feel like even after washing my face there is still a film from it on my skin.I should have properly researched the ingredients. The product is listed as paraben free, however, still contains petroleum derivatives and silicone and a slew of other synthetic crap.Stick to organic and raw oils like avocado and grapeseed if you have acne or oily skin. I tried this product on a whim and it was not only a waste of money, but now I'm broken out (when I wasn't before lol). That's what I get for not realizing a product with a commercial on YouTube and social media only exists for profit.I will probably use it on my feet, though. La Roche Posay my foot.",15

Zero SPF.  NO protection.",1.0,I assumed since I searched for moisturizer with SPF protection and this product was in the first 3 products to respond to that search that this would have at least a 30.  Wrong!  So much for assuming.  Would love be to return and get something appropriate but no returns even though I didn't open the box.  Not thrilled.

Wish I could return this",1.0,"I received it on May 30th and since I‚Äôve been using it, I noticed that I‚Äôve been breaking out in the areas that I concentrate it in the most. I‚Äôm not certain if this moisturizer is the main reason, but it‚Äôs mostly in my nose area, my chin and my cheeks. Some on my forehead, but not as much. I don‚Äôt usually have acne breakouts in this proportion. I find it unusual that I have this amount of acne this size near my cheeks after using this. Definitely be careful and avoid using if you notice you break out more often, it was a bit late for me though. My skin before using this is in the picture with the red striped shirt. My skin today is shown in the image with the pink shirt. At first I thought it was hydrating my skin but overall my skin doesn‚Äôt seem to be reacting well to it. I have combination skin and it‚Äôs sensitive.",12

Corn starch = doughy texture",1.0,"The only thing I like about this product is that it is fragrance free. I don‚Äôt like the consistency which is somewhat waxy, and I definitely don‚Äôt appreciate that when it dries on the face , it starts rolling off into gooey dough- like little balls. And no, it is not exfoliated skin rolling off- it is the product.The biggest annoyance though is that the ingredients listed on the Amazon page are much different than the ingredients listed on the box . My box lists corn starch and squalene, but those aren‚Äôt suppose to be in there, and if they changed their ingredients , they need to update  and disclose that to potential customers. I believe it is the starch in this cream that makes it ‚Äú pill‚Äù up , as so many other reviewers have noted.I definitely can not recommend this skin care product . I would imagine that there are better face creams at my local supermarket!",22

What a dissapointment",1.0,"Im not sure if it was a bad batch or this is how this product really is (first time buying and trying) but it started pilling. at first i thought maybe it was the eye cream ( different brand) i was using in addition to it, or the hyaluronic acid ( different brand) or the SPF (same brand) so i started using it separately and it was still pilling. I have a replacement coming so i will update after trying it and change my review then**updated 11/2:Received my replacement a few weeks ago and gave it a try... it is still pilling. Not as bad as the first one i bought and replaced, but still doing it. Don't buy this and find something else.",8

I also had reaction the Cetaphil Deep Hydration Moisturizer, so it's definitely my skin that's messed up and not the products.

I've never purchased a lotion product that was not sealed in some way. Also, I cannot confirm the reasonings behind this, but it made my eyes sting and water throughout the day until it was washed off. It could have been an allergic reaction to this product.

Edit : broke me out üò≠",1.0,"I've tried SOOOOO MANYYYYYYY moisturizers omg it's insane!!!! After watching the budget dermatologist talk about this moisturizer I decided to give it a try and I'M SO HAPPY I DID this is perfect for my skin! I have acne prone sensitive skin that can be really dry on my forehead and on my smile expression. This is godsend, it moisturizers so much and I hate oily and sticky stuff and this is just perfect, I can finally say I found the one for me because I was about to give up really üôÅ try this and if you don't like just return!------Update : after a few days using this moisturizer and loving it, I started breaking out really bad! It was the only thing I've changed in my skin care routine, and now I have 10+ pimples on my lovely face. It's SO FRUSTRATING to be me sometimes. I believe this was caused by the dimethicone in this product plus I have niacinamide sensitivity so maybe they were the ones causing my break outs. So unfortunate. I will go back to my vanicream moisturizer (I like it but it isn't the best for moisture! At least it won't break me out!) good luck for anyone else.",56

Awful!",1.0,I've heard so many good things about this brand and I see it in every dermatologist office so I thought I'd give it a try. Worst mistake ever. I developed a terrible rash everywhere I put it. It felt like I had sunburn. It dried out my skin and made it real red. The lotion pills a lot too. It seems like the entire LaRoche posay brand does this And I've tried all of their moisturizers. Even the ones that are supposed to be able to be used on babies. I can't believe this brand is endorsed by the American eczema society. Save your money on this one.,7

Searched in Amazon of course and I didn‚Äôt bother reading the reviews since I saw how many stars and I thought it was pretty high. Well my mistake!!

The lotion dried up and you will feel it off like crusts falling off once you rub your face!

The best thing about it is it does have ceramides, etc, is very gentle on sensitive skin, dries quickly and is non-greasy.  But it falls way short on the number one reason for a moisturizer...moisturization.  Left my skin still dry and crying out for a good,  deep moisturizer.  If you are young, with acne prone skin, this is probably a decent mositurizer for you.  But if you have dry skin or are older,  it's a fail.Update: at first I thought it must be my primer causing my foundation to pill up as I  was blending it out, so I stopped using the primer and it was still happening.  I stopped using this product and viola the pilling stopped.  Very weird considering how it was not very moisturizing.",6

Major Skin Breakouts",1.0,"I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to make sure I did this time. This moisturizer caused me a lot of breakouts and seriously irritated my skin. I get occasional flare ups from roseacea, nothing too serious. I generally don‚Äôt use anything to treat the condition, because most days it‚Äôs not a problem. I just keep a fairly simple skin care routine‚Äî moisturizer and basic nuetragena moisturizer plus Retin A at night and SPF daytime.In the past, I‚Äôve used fancy, expensive stuff from cosmetics shops, etc, as well as more basic stuff. This was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever used on my face, and I‚Äôm in my mid 40s, so that‚Äôs saying something.This moisturizer was a complete disaster for my skin. It caused major pimples and redness/irritation, even when used solo. (I alternate days for retin A.) As soon as I stopped using it, my skin cleared right up. I strongly recommend you skip this one altogether.",6

Nice consistency and hydrating but gave me a bumpy rash and caused itching",1.0,"I ordered this product after reading the great reviews because I have very dry sensitive skin. I was concerned about the pilling from the other reviews but found did not cause pilling for me due to the fact that I exfoliate my skin every other day. After using this product, though it was hydrating, it caused a slight itching sensation and caused me to develop bumps all over my face. I usually use Cleure products but wanted to try something new but will go back to using those as they do not cause an allergic reaction for me! I really wanted this to work but oh well. The product also arrived unsealed which is a bit of a red flag.My search for super hydrating, sensitive-skin friendly moisturizer continues......",6

Pills and leaves residue that looks like flakes everywhere",1.0,"I had high hopes! For some reason, I tried this 3 times, and each time, it left a million little pieces of pulled residue all over my face, eyelashes, and eyebrows that looked like a bunch of little flakes! I tried to wipe them off, but because they were all soft/gooey, they would just stick lower onto my face and then more of the moisturizer would roll up into more bits. It was hideous! Not a chance this could work under makeup. I just started retinol, so I was worried it was my skin peeling, but it wasn't peeling. It was the product peeling. I used my other moisturizers after rehashing my face each time and it never happened with them. Tried this again, the polling/residue bits happened immediately. A return, sadly. I'm bummed; everyone loves this product so I hoped it would work for me. Maybe mine was old or a bad batch? I dunno.",4

Pills Horribly! It‚Äôs a No!",1.0,"I‚Äôve used the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer for several weeks. I really wanted to like it but pills horribly.

Needs more hydration...",1.0,"I‚Äôve used this the past few nights. When used after serums which leave behind a slight wetness, I think this moisturizer is okay. But used on clean skin by itself, it dried up, balled up / pilled / got ash-like very quickly, and that‚Äôs at night, not even including the daytime concerns of face masks or sunscreens. So, unfortunately this won‚Äôt be a daytime ‚Äúone and done‚Äù option for me before putting on a face mask to go to work. And unfortunately it also won‚Äôt be an option for me to use before sunscreens in the morning, especially not under face masks. The ‚Äúpilling‚Äù would be an absolute nightmare in both cases. So, this product is just too restrictive as is, and I cannot recommend it for broad usage. Used at night however, following hydrating toners / serums, if never ever touched, for people who sleep on their backs only, it could be manageable for a touch of moisture, but I will not be repurchasing this. I‚Äôll keep looking.",3

Sadly, do not recommend!",1.0,"I got this on May and truly wanted to like it.Cons:1.When I first got it my eyes started burning and getting watery in just minutes. I was not sweating.

Also didn‚Äôt see a point in not covering my forehead and around my eyes anymore.2.Every time I got more than normal sun exposure I would notice I would break out with several pimples. This happened several times and I refused to believe it was this but after the 5th time in 3 months I accepted that it was.Pros:1.When I applied it under my makeup it didn‚Äôt get me oily.After 3 months I gave up and unfortunately will not use this anymore.

Great moisturizer because it contains no hyaluronic acid! But not cruelty-free.",1.0,"UPDATE: I won't be purchasing this again since it is not cruelty-free.There's a little-know fact about hyaluronic acid that folks should be aware of; it amplifies actives like retintols and tretinoin and can cause more of a reaction than those actives should normally. So, this is a great moisturizer to use if you use a moisturizer in combination with any actives as it will not interact with them.Sure hyaluronic acid is great if you're using it alone or without actives in that it can help to moisturize the skin, but it should be avoided when using anti-aging actives and exfoliants.",3
