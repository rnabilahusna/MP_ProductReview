AMAZING",5.0,"This is my Folliculitis Journey and i include ALL THE PRODUCTS I USED to get rid of it.I got Folliculitis on my groin area, i had no idea what it was since i have never had it but it started spreading down my legs and leaving these dark marks/scars. The lesions started multiplying, i went to the doctors who gave me an ointment gel, which did absolutely nothing for me, it was an acne treatment.Since it started getting hotter and summer was near i knew i had to act fast or else i would have to wear pants all summer. First things first, from my research it states not to shave to prevent he spread of Folliculitis, so yes i did just that. I didn't shave for over a month...i know gross but it had to be done.*If you do decide to shave, use a new fresh blade every time you shave in order to prevent spread. Also if you have folliculitis on your legs don't use the same blade on your armpits etc.I looked up items on amazon and read reviews for ""Almond Clear: Body Clearing Serum"" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0866B6CV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1I decided to give it a try, i started with Level 1 and used it with the Hibliclens antibacterial soap as everyone in the reviews did. I already had the soap since its so amazing and i recommend everyone have thissoap in their home it works miracles. I was already using this soap by itself for about 2 weeks prior to buying the Almond Clear bottle and i noticed no difference. When i read that buyers were combining both Almond Clear Serum and the soap i decided to do the same, but still i felt that Hibliclens did not do much for me. My Folliculitis was very stubborn!https://www.amazon.com/Molnlycke-Hibiclens-HIBICLENS-LIQ-OZ/dp/B00E5R65SA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GNSU7PU7YVEN&dchild=1&keywords=hibiclens&qid=1590613599&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=hibi%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-3*Everyone is different so what works for someone might not work for others.As for the Almond Clear serum, i noticed immediately a difference! overnight the lesions seemed like they shrunk.The only complaint is that the bottle doesn't contain much. I had a big area to cover so 1 bottle was finished in 1 week. I would definitely recommend you purchase the bigger bottle so its worth your money (they have the 4oz option available). Also level 1 is more for someone who might have like 1-4 lesions..or for sensitive areas like the face. I felt like it made a difference but i definitely needed something stronger to completely get rid of them, i should've skipped to level2 like everyone else did in the reviews.I bought level 2 when i ran out of level 1 and i definitely noticed a huge difference! Listen to me right now, if you suffer from severe Folliculitis YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!Honestly my case got so bad i had so many lesions on my groin area they started spreading down to my thighs and legs and even my private area :(i was so stressed i couldn't wear shorts and even pants would cause me to breakout in hives and the infected areawould get so red and irritated easily. It got bad!Luckily this product saved my life..I started using this April 20, today is May 27 and i am pretty much cured, the lesions are all gone and even the scars are faded! This product faded the nasty dark marks.The reviews recommend using up to 2xs a day. This did not work for me, my skin is very sensitive so i would only use 1x a day, every night after i showered i would apply and leave overnight. I do have to say that this product makes your skin peel and drys your skin out. For me, it made my skin excessively dry and i would shed skin almost everyday.Because my skin was getting beyond dry i decided to moisturize. I used CeraVe Moistorizing Lotion every morning when i woke up.*(make sure to always wash your hands before and after you apply a product to prevent from spreading to other body parts).https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YJ2SLG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I used this lotion because alot of people with skin issues use this lotion and it works well, i had no issues, great product!I shower every night so i decided to use a Folliculitis body wash i found on Amazon. I leave it on the area for about 5 mins then i rinse. I also noticed a big difference with this product right after the 1st use! I used this product for about 1.5 months?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBL3RES/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1Another product i used in the shower was the Nizoral Shampoo. I saw YouTube videos of people who used it on their arms and face to treat folliculitis. Luckily i already had this shampoo as well, its to treat dandruff, i recommend for both dandruff and for folliculitis, i feel like this items made a difference. I replaced the Hibliclens soap with this product, i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then rinse in the shower. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AINMFAC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The final product i used was Defense Soap, i used this soap in order to kill any bacteria or fungi that might have been causing the Folliculitis. I felt like this also made a difference and i washed my whole body with this in order to prevent any Folliculitis from spreading on my stomach or arms...I was terrified of getting it any where else, the soap makes you feel fresh and clean specially after a workout! It does dry your skin so you don't have to use everyday, but if you do i would definitely recommend to moisturize with the CeraVe lotion or just any lotion in general. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HYBK2YF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1*Be sure to use these products EVERYDAY, TO SEE RESULTS YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT.If you are on a budget: Out of all the products i would definitely recommend you use the Almond Clear Serum and the Folliculitis Body Wash by Ovante. Yes i know this is a VERY LONG routine and so many products to use, but all my folliculitis is pretty much gone already! It is pricey to buy all these items, but honestly i was willing to pay $100+ in order to get rid of this and it was worth it!I guess it depends how bad do you want to get rid of this? I think its worth it!Do your research, find out what works for you, try different products until you find something that works for your skin. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE!",153

TOP-NOTCH SKIN CARE!!! - great moisturizing, wears light, lasts a long time, non-irritating, & great with major skin conditions!",5.0,"As you can see from all of the positive and thoughtful reviews here, CeraVe's standard lotion (this product) is a fantastic moisturizer (and likewise, most everything they make is spectacular). This is really top-notch skin care.CeraVe is often mentioned in the same sentence with lotions and creams from companies like Cetaphil and VaniCream. These are products made not just to give you serious skin care, but made in a fashion to avoid ingredients that can make sensitive skin very irritated. They make expensive lotions, creams, soaps, and sunscreen, but they make very, very, very high-quality products that give the best performance you can get (in fact, this stuff is so good that numerous independent reviews have identified products from CeraVe, Cetaphil, and VaniCream to be superior to many of the ""designer"" skin care products that often cost hundreds of dollars per bottle!!! Further, ask a dermatologist [or an allergist who specializes in skin conditions] which moisturizer they prefer and you will most likely hear one of those three names!!!)I happen to be one of those people that if I apply a lotion or cream with one or more of the (many) ingredients that tends to irritate sensitive skin, 10 minutes later you might freak out from seeing a person who is (literally) the color red and call 911. No lie...certain irritants cause me to have a reaction that could only be described as ""freaky"". As CeraVe is built on the reputation of making non-irritating products, this Lotion (and most all of their product line) is a blessing for people like me (VaniCream applies here as well.) But the ""non-irritating"" aspect is just one of the reasons these products are so great...their performance in how well they moisturize and help repair damaged skin is another reason for such great reputations.Like the other names mentioned above, CeraVe makes a few skin care products for different uses and applications. This particular one is their standard Lotion, and it is their ""lighter"" moisturizer (with their creams being heavier). Made to work well for everyone and designed to be a great ""day"" moisturizer for people of all skin types & conditions, it gives...---excellent immediate relief from that itchy feeling from dryness and feeling or irritation,---healing at a much faster speed than without the usage or with any standard lotion, and---long-lasting protection (one application will get you through the day).Also, it is...---well-suited to people with sensitivities to irritants & those suffering from any of a long list of major skin conditions---not greasy once worked in,---designed NOT to clog pores and NOT to irritate acne,---very easy to work in,---wears lightly without any feeling of ""residue,"" and---works great as a post-shave lotion for reducing irritation/razor burn without causing further irritation that some after-shave lotions can do.My personal usage of this product is (in combination with a few products from Cetaphil, VaniCream Lite, Gold Bond, Eurcerin, and Aveeno [depending which is on sale/available]) as my 'day moisturizer'. At night, I use VaniCream's original Cream, which is a fantastic cream, but it is heavy and not something I want to wear during the day. This Cerave is much easier to work in, wears lightly without any residue feeling, but still delivers powerful healing to skin and lasts a long time. So a little bit of this CeraVe in the morning and I am good until the end of the day when I shower***.The biggest downside here is price. CeraVe is a premium product, and so it comes at a premium price. With that said, your money isn't only going ""to the name"" because this product works exceptionally well and I personally feel its performance justifies its price many times over. The difference it can make can be tremendous, and better skin often means an improvement in quality of life, which is something you can't put a price tag on. So if you are considering trying CeraVe, my personal advice is that you should go for it as you will most likely be very satisfied with the outcome.(***if you have SERIOUS dry skin, check out CeraVe's or VaniCream's creams; this for the day and the cream at night can tackle serious skin issues like a champ!)",15

CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion: A Drugstore Hero for Dry Skin",5.0,"I like the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion and I have been using the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for over a year. It is an excellent choice for people with dry or sensitive skin looking for an affordable and effective moisturizer. I have dry skin and I am also sensitive to some fragrances. However, if you have oily skin or prefer a thicker lotion, you may want to consider another option. This lotion is very affordable, especially when you consider the large 19-ounce bottle size. A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last you a long time. This lotion does not contain any SPF, so you will need to wear a separate sunscreen if you will be spending time in the sun.",0

Works amazing on chapped lips!",5.0,"Wow! I gotta say right off I do not really use lotion often, I work outdoors everyday so I never really saw a point. The last month I've been working a really dusty dry job site and got sick on top of it. When I tell you my nose AND LIPS were more chapped dry and cracked than they have ever been in my 33 year life I'm serious! 100% I used probably 2 dollops the size of a nickel and no Exaggeration whatsoever in almost instanly i had relief from the pain and within 5 minutes my nose AND LIPS were restored to go normal,  5 MINUTES!!!

It became more and more difficult to get an appointment, but I continued to go to him regularly. Over the years he had a line of skin products that he sold to his patients. I asked him if any of them were as good as Cerave moisturizer. He told me not to change and keep using it. My skin always look luminous and smooth after over 25 years.

Parabens are fine. Stop with the fear-mongering.",5.0,Listen to me: THIS PRODUCT WORKS. Ingredients are listed from highest to lowest concentration. Parabens are normally 3/4th the way down the list or dead last. They will not hurt you. You know what will cause immediate contact dermatitis? Phenoxyethanol - the preservative dujour beauty companies now are using to replace parabens with the Paraben Mafia shows up to complain. Their complaints are ruining beautiful skincare lines that absolutely work.Again: this product is wonderful. NO BREAKOUTS. Clear skin. Healed skin. 100 stars if I could.,12
