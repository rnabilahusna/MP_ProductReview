Feels nice, but made my skin break out",2.0,"I use the face wash that recommended using the moisturizer as well for the best results. I opted for the SPF one to be better for my skin, but it makes me break out when I normally don't have any issues with acne since I'm 35. I thought about trying the regular moisturizer, but I think I'll go back to the Belif one I was using previously. I spent way too many years dealing with acne to start fighting with that again! üôÉ",0

Allergic reaction",2.0,"The first time I used this product my skin felt amazing soft. But soon after that I noticed that I was having an allergic reaction. I have a rash on my face and my skin is flaky and dry now. Unfortunately, my skin hates niacinamide. I really wanted to love this product.",0

Harsh for Sensitive Skin.",2.0,"This product was recommended by several You-Tube Dermatologists and very well endorsed, unfortunately, the formulation causes irritation, drying and peeling especially around the eyes.  This is the 2nd tube I've purchased and now realize its much to harsh due to the Niacinamide and Ceramides used in the formulation.  Both of which I'm sensitive to and found that out the hard way. There's a good reason why the high-end moisturizers and creams are better tolerated on the skin especially when using Niacinamide and Ceramides. Drug store brands need to be carefully used especially on mature skin.",0

I unfortunately had to return it, as it burned like the son of a biscuit-eating bulldog. I must have extremely sensitive skin, because there are times when the Baume B5 can sting for a second. Sometimes, ceramides are even too strong for a damaged facial barrier. During these times, I use original Vanicream.",0

3 out of 10",2.0,I bought this to put on my face at night and in the morning before my make routine. Problem is it burns my eyes. Even if I try not to get it close to my eyes it stings. Not sure if this is some kind of reaction to the ingredients? Also it‚Äôs probably not a good night moisturizer for night use because of the SPF. It says broad spectrum SPF in light yellow letters. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if I saw this. Not a fan of sun screens.,0

Didn't work for me",2.0,"I have very dry patches of bumpy skin on my cheeks from keratosis pilaris. Very few products work. I tried this and saw no improvement in the bumps. On the bright side, it does tend to pill and I used it to pill and exfoliate my face. I put the lotion on, let it set, then cleanse my face really well and then some dead skin comes off. Hence why I give it 2 stars, not 1. It isn't perfumed and has a negligible medicinal scent. The tube doesn't last too long (less than a month for me with pretty minimal amounts used every evening) and seems expensive for how much product you really get. I think it's worth a try but doesn't work for kp sufferers. I had better luck with Hydroboost by Neutrogena or the gel moisturizer by Clinique.",0

My skin felt sticky for a couple of hours, then it felt as if I hadn't used anything.  This was a waste of money and neither my daughter nor my granddaughter want to bother to try it.

I wanted to love it",2.0,"I stated using this to help with my flaking skin from my prescription retinols.  I tossed all my other moisturizers with fragrance and that weren‚Äôt working and committed to this.  My flaking has stopped but I believe it‚Äôs more to do with changing my face wash. This pills horribly. For the price it doesn‚Äôt feel luxurious on my skin and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even worth it. I have to put on a soaking wet face after a shower or warm face wash to get it to even absorb just a bit.  Forget about layering with anything else or makeup. I‚Äôll be returning it and trying something else instead.Edit to add: I read some other reviews and decided to buy a bottle at target.  NO PILLING! With the Amazon one I had to go through this whole ritual of washing my face, leaving it damp, putting in the LP cream, letting it dry and adding my retinol cream. I had to cut out any serums after that.With the target one I did my ritual with good results. Then I decided to just go ahead put on my LP cream (it absorbs faster and doesn‚Äôt just sit on my skin) wait a second, put on my retinols, and added my serum back info my routine. No pilling again. Maybe the Amazon version is old or coming from a different facility.",0

Peels off",2.0,"Have it for almost 2.5 now of 1-time a day consistent use. Still not close to finish!Initially I thought it peeled off, however, turned out it was my face skin! I am using a retinoid on my face so my skin peels off like crazy, and I thought it was cream pieces. I decided tot test on my inner forearm and the cream stays on (and gets absorbed) perfectly on my forearm skin no matter how much I tried rubbing it to cross out the peeling off issue. Yes, it is indeed a good cream. I amstill surprised that my generous use did not waste the whole pack.My skin stings though while on a strong retinoid when I use this cream. This is not entirely the cream‚Äôs problem but will remove one star for it, as Vanicream doesn‚Äôt sting my skin. Maybe they could make the ingredients slightly less irritating?",0

It's alright",2.0,"I wanted to get the regular moisturizer but got the one with sunscreen idk why. I dont like it honestly. Makes your skin look oily af. Plus on the YUKA app it tells you this is apparently bad since it has ingredients that cause sun allergy which is what I have and it sucks so much if I'm in the sun for too long. This basically boosts that up. Smh. I thought LRP is good after all the hype about it but guess not. CeraVe is bad, Aveeno is ok. LRP is ok so far. Nothing from their line has helped me with my skin concerns. I might as well switch to Korean brands",0

Not for all users with rosacea",2.0,"I recently found out that I have rosacea, and after going through all these recommended products for rosacea, someone was raving about La Roche-Posay moisturizer. I was really excited to try this out since I found out 90% of my skincare products were just a big no for me now. Well, let me tell you, other rosacea sufferers, that this moisturizer is just not for everyone. Here's why.This moisturizer stings - yes, it stings! Like, ouch! Upon applying it on my face that was washed with a sensitive-skin friendly cleanser, I put a dab of this moisturizer on my face and could feel it starting to sting. Then, the rosacea would appear brightly on my face. On top of that, my face felt extremely oily as if it was from this moisturizer. Now, the moisturizer does say that it's oil-free; however, it really didn't feel like it.One plus thing about this moisturizer is that after applying it on my face, I didn't have any more of that itchiness. I do think it is doing its job as moisturizing, but it's also triggering my rosacea.Also, if anyone is using the Cetaphil sunblock along with this moisturizer, I do advise you to use it with care. I'll write a review for that sunblock, but these two do not mix well.",7

It actually looked like it had been opened. I had to return it because there‚Äôs no way I could gift something that arrived in terrible condition that could‚Äôve been tampered with. My advise?

May be others' cup of tea, but not mine",2.0,"The only reason I dislike this moisturizer so much is because of the rolling. Like, if you move your fingers across your face or try to swipe on makeup, it looks like your skin's peeling off...I liked it initially because it goes on very light and SEEMED to absorb well. My skin felt moisturized, but anytime I put on makeup or rubbed my skin, it looked like I recently got a facial peel. I thought at first it was another product I was using, but after I stopped using the other product, my skin didn't stop looking like it was peeling after putting on moisturizer. Over time I've realized that it's just the moisturizer rolling off, not my skin, and underneath it, my skin doesn't actually feel that moisturized after all (once the moisturizer rolls off). It appears to absorb very well, so it's hard to tell how much you've put on. If you put on very, very little, you won't have the peeling. But, you also won't have any moisturizing. It's a catch 22.Pros: absolutely for sensitive skin - I had no problems with it ACTUALLY peeling my skin or anything crazyPeople seem to like this, so maybe it's just me, but it's an expensive moisturizer that just peels off and doesn't seem to do much.",3

This is a sunscreen with moisturizer, not a moisturizer with sunscreen.",2.0,"Update: it's as I feared.  This product is too thick and greasy, never fully absorbs into the skin and you cannot put makeup over it without pilling.  I did not see any changes to my skin.  I will not be purchasing this product again.I will come back later to update, but on arrival I am disappointed because this product is not what I wanted. I wanted a facial moisturizer with spf, as advertised, but this is a sunscreen with moisturizers.I know that some will think it's the same thing or I'm being petty, but they are completely different things. The thickness and the way sunscreen absorbs vs a moisturizer with spf is night and day. Sunscreen tends to pill under makeup as well while moisturizers are better designed to be used in layers on the face. This is thicker and greasier feeling than I wanted.I am definitely willing to give it a shot and I hope I eat my words, but I really also hope that the seller advertises it as sunscreen because that's what it is.I'll be back in a month to update!",148

I‚Äôve heard such great things, however, this product just doesn‚Äôt feel moisturizing or hydrating on my skin at all. It has a thick consistency which may be due to the sunscreen in it but it feels heavy on my face and none soothing at all. Moisturizing has always been my favorite part of my skincare routine but this stuff just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. My face has been breaking out which normally I‚Äôm not sensitive to either.

I was a loyal customer, but I won‚Äôt be buying their products anymore. Very disappointed.",2.0,"UPDATE: this update is a few months late, but I did hear back from their customer service. They first told me to try the product without using any toner or oil underneath. Then they said to go to  dermatologist and get my skin checked. Apparently it‚Äôs a product that can only be used by people with perfect skin. I have pretty good skin, and I‚Äôve never had this problem with any other moisturizer. What a shame. Don‚Äôt buy this project.Original Review-I used to love La Roche-Posay. I‚Äôve been using their cleansers for a long time. I wanted to give their moisturizer and their sunscreen a try, but I am very disappointed. Like other reviews, this product causes a lot of pilling. I‚Äôm only able to use this on my face right now because of the quarantine I don‚Äôt go out much. Don‚Äôt use this moisturizer with makeup. Prior to writing this review I reached out to their customer service asking if it‚Äôs an old moisturizer or I should use a different product, but I got no response.

Yep, it pills.",2.0,"This would be perfectly fine if it didn‚Äôt pill so badly. Another reviewer implied that people are using the product wrong and the pilling is just dead skin from not exfoliating. That is incorrect. As someone who takes very good care of my skin, and exfoliates regularly, this is just a crappy product. The pilling is balled up dried moisturizer. It‚Äôs too bad because it has a lot of good qualities, but the pilling issue makes it unusable. I can‚Äôt use it at night because I need a heavier moisturizing cream at night, and I can‚Äôt use it in the morning because it will destroy my makeup.

After applying, this moisturizer leaves many very visible small clumps of product on your skin.After trying various ways to alleviate this problem, using different toners, no toner, less product etc, nothing helps, it still does not absorb into skin.Horrible waste of money.",0

Perfect if you like lotion that ""pills"" up all over your face",2.0,"I wanted to love this moisturizer after seeing it recommended by various YouTube personalities and reading the reviews on Amazon. It's a good moisturizer when used by itself, with no other products. However, when I apply this on top of anything else...serums, Vitamin C, tretinoin...the moisturizer pills terribly! There are flaky white bits all over my face and I feel like it's pulling off everything I just put on my face. I contemplated throwing it out but I think I'll repurpose it for hand/foot cream until it runs out. I will not buy this again.",0

It's a basic moisturizer",2.0,It tends to pill up on the skin if you even put just barely too much on so it doesn't work great under makeup.  There are better moisturizers out there for the same price.,0

It does definitely pill",2.0,"I wish I had looked at some of the reviews more thoroughly before buying this.  I use the same brand's cleanser so figured this could replace my COSRX moisturizer. Nope this isn't even that moisturizing and in the top of that it pills horribly.  Mind you,  I've tried applying it multiple ways,  with serum, with oil, but by itself it pills",0
