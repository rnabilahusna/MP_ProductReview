LOVE IT!! lightweight, lovely moisturizer w/ spf and skin loving ingredients LOVE IT!!!!",5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It will be a repurchase.It is creamy, smooth, lightweight. It does not feel like an SPF product. It is so light and airy feeling.My skin: mid 40s, clear, NON acne Rosacea (just visible veins, some flushing), normal to dry skin, semi sensitive--though less so since incorporating skin barrier building and protecting ingredients (hence my love of La Roche Posay products).Yes, I love La Roche-Posay products. Seems there is something for everyone. I recommend checking out all they have to offer, and WHY. Such good ingredients. I have used their Toleraine creamy face cleanser, cicaplast baume, hydrating mask, assortment of sunscreens, and most recently this Toleraine Double Repair Face Moisturizer with SPF 30.I tend to have a pretty solid skin care routine for night. For day time, it is pretty much whatever I feel like using, with emphasis on SPF. Most of the year I can do a combo of various morning products plus my SPF, but when it gets extra hot.. I just go with SPF because I will just sweat off good product. I am more apt to reapply during day as well as sometimes rinse my hot sticky face and then  reapply. I figured using a product that is both moisturizer AND SPF, as well as contain some other skin loving, skin barrier building goodies would be perfect. I immediately checked out the offerings of La Roche Posay, and am thrilled to have made this purchase.Not to scare you off, as it didn't me, but I want to share.. At first, my skin seemed to flush pretty hard upon initial application. It didn't deter me from further use, since there is nothing in it that is troublesome. However, it is a new product for my skin, and it contains niacinamide which my skin never encountered before. Not too concerned, I continued to use it every morning. It seems to be even better as time goes on. I have been using it every single day for nearly a month. My skin didn't get red beyond the first couple of uses and seemed to simmer down a lot. My skin has also seemed mildly greasy at first (a never on my dry skin!), but that too simmered down with repeated use.  It looks really good, or extra good these days!!!!! My skin simply feels happily moisturized and at no point during day does it feel dry, nor does it feel greasy (not sure what that initial reaction was).  I feel like i have done something GOOD FOR MY SKIN when I use this. Hard no to recommend it :)I have used it alone, I have used it over serums. I have used it under make up. I dont often wear make up, so I cant report much about my experience. When I do, I tend to use a little less than normal, let it set for awhile, then go back and add make-up. Usually my make up also has SPF.So yeh.. give it a try. Hope this helped. Take care :)",82

Exceptional Hydration with La Roche-Posay Toleriane",5.0,"As someone who appreciates the finer details in both technology and skincare, I recently tried the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer and was thoroughly impressed. My daily routine, which often involves long hours in front of a computer, requires a skincare product that not only rejuvenates but also protects.The Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer stands out for its lightweight formula that is easily absorbed into the skin. Its non-greasy texture is a major plus, particularly for those long days spent at the University of Florida where I work on advanced computing projects. The moisturizer provided my skin with much-needed hydration without any heaviness or residue.What I particularly appreciate about this product is its commitment to sensitive skin. The fragrance-free and non-comedogenic formula aligns well with my preference for skincare products that are gentle yet effective. In the realm of software development and research, where attention to detail is paramount, this moisturizer echoes a similar ethos in skincare.The moisturizer's dual-action approach, combining ceramide-3 and prebiotic thermal water, is like integrating the best of two worlds, akin to the front-end and back-end development in software. It repairs the skin barrier and restores skin's natural protective properties, which is essential for someone like me who spends a significant amount of time in air-conditioned environments.In conclusion, the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer is a product I would highly recommend. Its blend of science-backed ingredients and user-friendly application makes it a top choice for professionals seeking a reliable and effective skincare solution. It's a small, yet significant step towards self-care amidst a busy lifestyle.",29

Live up to its brand",5.0,"Here's a general review based on its reputation up to that point:1. Hydration: One of the standout features of this moisturizer is its ability to provide deep and long-lasting hydration. It contains ingredients like glycerin and ceramides, which help replenish and lock in moisture, making it suitable for my dry skin.2. Skin Barrier Support: This product is formulated to support and strengthen the skin's natural barrier. The inclusion of ceramides helps improve the skin's protective function, making it more resilient against environmental stressors and preventing moisture loss.3. Non-Comedogenic: La Roche-Posay is known for creating products that are gentle on sensitive and acne-prone skin. The Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer is non-comedogenic, which means it's less likely to clog pores and cause breakouts.4. Fragrance-Free: It is fragrance-free, making it an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin or a fragrance allergy.5. Lightweight Texture: I often appreciate the lightweight and non-greasy texture of this moisturizer. It absorbs well into the skin without leaving a heavy or sticky feeling.6. Value for Money: The product is typically available at a reasonable price point, but it runs out fast! Maybe I applied way too much because of how fast it absorbs into my skin.Overall, the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer is wonderful for its hydrating and skin-barrier-supporting properties, making it a suitable choice for individuals looking for a gentle yet effective daily moisturizer, particularly those with dry or sensitive skin.",56

A Game-Changer for Stubborn Sunscreen Haters",5.0,"I recently purchased the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair UV SPF Moisturizer for my mom, who has always been stubborn when it comes to protecting her skin from the sun. She's tried various sunscreens in the past but found them to be too oily, which made her reluctant to use them consistently. However, this moisturizer with SPF 30 has been a true revelation for her, and I couldn't be happier.First and foremost, what sets this moisturizer apart is its ability to address my mom's specific concerns. It not only provides essential sun protection with SPF 30 but also incorporates niacinamide and glycerin, which work together to hydrate and nourish the skin. This combination of benefits ensures that her skin stays moisturized and protected without feeling heavy or greasy.My mom's glowing review of this product revolves around its non-oily formula. She was initially skeptical, as previous sunscreens left her with a shiny and uncomfortable residue on her skin. However, this moisturizer pleasantly surprised her. It absorbs quickly and leaves her skin feeling smooth and matte, eliminating any concerns about an overly oily appearance. It has truly won her over with its lightweight and non-greasy texture.As her daughter, it brings me comfort to know that my mom is finally taking proper care of her skin. The La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair UV SPF Moisturizer not only satisfies her pickiness when it comes to sunscreen but also provides her with the protection she needs. It's a relief to see her embrace a product that keeps her skin safe from the harmful effects of the sun.Moreover, this moisturizer is a practical and convenient option for daily use. Its oil-free formulation ensures that it won't clog pores or contribute to breakouts, making it suitable for various skin types. The addition of SPF 30 provides effective protection against both UVA and UVB rays, making it a reliable choice for everyday sun protection.In conclusion, the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair UV SPF Moisturizer is a game-changer for anyone who has been hesitant or reluctant to use sunscreen due to its oily nature. Its non-greasy formula, combined with the benefits of niacinamide and glycerin, makes it a standout choice for those seeking moisturizing sun protection without the unwanted shine. If you or your loved ones struggle with sunscreen options, I highly recommend giving this moisturizer a try. It not only satisfies picky preferences but also provides peace of mind knowing that proper skin protection is being prioritized.",80

Love love love",5.0,"I absolutely love La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer! This daily moisturizer has been a game-changer for my sensitive skin. It feels lightweight yet deeply hydrating, and it doesn't leave any greasy residue. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall appearance since using this cream.

Product is GREAT but EXPENSIVE!!!",5.0,"This is my fourth time buying this product. To be honest, this is probably going to be my moisturizer for a long time. It states “Fragrance Free” but it actually has a nice little smell to it, does an AMAZING job moisturizing your face, and is very enjoyable to apply. However, it is EXPENSIVE. On Amazon it’s listed at $22.99 and the bottle is smaller than you think. The first time I used this moisturizer I was enjoying applying it so much I began using a bit more than I should have. Do not make my mistake. Unless you are a millionaire, use as little as possible, it will still do its job. After sales tax this product comes to around $24, and unless you want to be spending that every two weeks on a moisturizer, preserve it!!!",4

Unscented and Effective",5.0,"I have a fragrance sensitivity, and many times I purchase products labeled ""unscented"" but still perceive a fragrance - but to me this moisturizer is completely fragrance-free.  I am in my 60's so I don't believe any moisturizer can actually reverse the skin-aging time clock.  What I am always searching for is a fragrance-free  face moisturizer that applies easily and adds suppleness to my skin without any sticky or greasy feeling.  This moisturizer fits the bill perfectly, so as long as the manufacturer doesn't change the formulation, I'll happily continue to purchase it - my long quest is over!",4

Magic in a bottle: I’m 32. 3rd update at bottom",5.0,"There I was.It was a Tuesday, mid October, 2018. I’m pacing Walgreens skin care aisle, reading labels up & down. Sweaty & hormonal, pregnant & confused.There she was; the esthetician angel hired by Walgreens. She approaches me.“How can I help you?” I look at her, she looks at me. She must be in her 60s? But her skin looks flawless. (Seriously do pores just disappear at her age?) She doesn’t even have wrinkles, except for some beautifully placed smile lines.“Sure,” I mumble; clearly disheartened. “My face is freaking out. I’ve spent $100+ these last few months trying to fix it. I’ve never had an issue-before this pregnancy- & I don’t know what’s wrong with my skin!” I continue to vent hormonally, “Breaking out, greasy one moment & dry & flaky the next-“She nods her head up & down as I speak, eyes shimmering in understanding behind her rimless glasses. She’s been here before.“Have you tried La Roche moisturizer? It’s probiotic thermal water works miracles.”I haven’t of course.My fairy godmother (for who else could this angel be?) hands me the unsuspecting bottle. $20 dollars? I scoff inwardly at the high price tag, not fully understanding yet what a gift this is.SPF or no spf? (It doesn’t matter I later find out, they both were made by the beautiful witches of the west & represent it.)It worked that very night. My face literally healed in 24 hours. (Read the back of the bottle. It does what it says)18 months later, I’m on my 5th bottle. My face is supple, even, and I barely wear makeup. (cc cream by it, & that’s it.)It’s magical. Whats in this bottle? Sorcery perhaps?“ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC”My only wish is it came in a bigger bottle.*ive added a photo with myself wearing it cc cream, but you can see my face looks lovely. Thank you fairy god mother of science. THANK YOU**Update: 2022Just ordered another bottle. Read some reviews & wanted to comment about the “pilling”. The pilling is dead skin….exfoliate before. I’m on my, like 10th? bottle or something. From personal experience I’ve noticed if I don’t exfoliate & just “put it on” without properly cleaning & taking care of my face-pilling WILL happen. I actually take it as an indication I need to take better care of my face.I wasn’t paid anything for this review.Not even a “give us a good review & you get a free bottle” discount. WHICH I AM cool with.I personally take those little postcards as offensive little star-grabbing buggards messing with the review system.Anywho. My hair is longer in the 2nd photo…that’s how long I’ve been using this lotion. My kid is a toddler & we’re looking for baby #2…Never going without this stuff as I can tell when I don’t moisturize & maintain my “protective layer” on my skin with this magic lotion. Cheers to less blotchy, angry, skin peeps.**Update: 2023Ah! I ran out and went through a thing with my mental health for like 6 months. I stopped being kind to myself, and then I became pregnant w/ our 2nd & (just like last time) my face freaked out.After some self love & use of this product, my face got better again. This time I took before and afters with no makeup…might have been embarrassed to post these once upon a time, but I'm hoping to help others if they’re having a rough time with their skin. After using this continuously, my face feels & looks healthy again. Yay :) Seriously this stuff is amazing.",0

Heals without stinging",5.0,"I think this is the third review I've written on anything in my life, but I thought this review would be of help.If you have any kind of facial skin irritation, dryness, scrapes, or just general tiredness, this is the stuff you want.  The price looks insane, but after using just a dime size amount, your problems are gone the next morning.I had chafing on my eyes, eyelids, forehead, nose from an extreme work schedule of 6 days on with overtime, in a very nasty environment.  Masks, gloves, particulate matter, and a general backside whoopin daily.  My eyes and skin started to crack and scab from the abuse.I got this stuff.  Applied it at night after washing, and thought it didn't take much to apply.  Also doesn't sting like most other under $10 products.  Rubbed it into my eyelids- no burning.  It stayed where you put it.  So that was nice.But even nicer is that when I woke the next day, my face had healed.  No roughness, scratches, or abrasions to be found.  And beyond that, I even looked 'younger', if that's even a thing.  I don't particularly care about that part, but I do care about my body getting torn to shreds.  And this fixed it.So manly men out there, drop some coin on this if you are getting hit with skin damage on the regular.  This stuff works so well I'm almost afraid to see what's really in it.  And this is likely my last review for this decade.  Thanks to the people that made it.  Take care.",5

I’m a Believer",5.0,"At 52, I have reached the point where my love of sun and hatred of sunscreen back in the day, have produced pre-cancerous spots on my face and chest - oh yay. I promised my dermatologist that I’d use a moisturizer with sunscreen. UGH… have you noticed how many are out there that give the dreaded “white cast” on your face or are SO thick feeling on your skin you swear its a joke and your husband replaced it with pudding on April Fools Day.But not this stuff!!!! I did the searches and read articles trying to find something that (first) wasn’t heavy, didn’t make me look like Casper the Friendly Ghost, or smelled like sunblock. I used Ole’s newly created 30 SPF moisturizer sunscreen but it felt sticky and didn’t feel “healthy” on my face, if that makes sense. I was devastated because I love all things Ole.Then I decided that I’d give this stuff a go. GAME CHANGER! It smells nice, isn’t heavy, and has a very minimal white cast (and that’s only if you use a ton; which you won’t because a little goes a long way!) Now remember I said I was a sun loving kid and lived through the “baby oil is best sunblock,” so I have some dark spots, little lines, discolorations etc. literally everything stereotypical of my generation. (Ha!) Well, NOT ANYMORE! I am completely serious when I say my dark spots are almost completely invisible, lines look smoother - the whole deal!Super long story short, I’m dropping the brand I’ve used everyday for over a decade, to use this stuff. The cleanser, vitamin C serum,  you name it. Now click on that “Add to cart” button NOW!",6

Perfect for me",5.0,"So, until I turned 40, I did not care about skin routines, so I did not have one.  After turning 40, I figured I should start taking care of my skin, so I did some fairly in-depth research online on products that would work for my mixed (oily/dry) skin without my having to get a second job or second mortgage.  This product was the leader for that category. I should also note that I do not wear makeup, so I do not know how this product impacts makeup application.I have paired this moisturizer with a cleanser for sensitive skin, and I use it every morning at least.  This moisturizer provides just enough moisturization to make my skin feel soft and glowy without adding to any of my T-zone issues.  I have had no issues with pore clogging or skin reactions to this moisturizer, and I have grown to love it.  There is very little scent, and whatever is there does not last long, so that is not an issue for me. I can now feel when I have forgotten to put it on, and my skin is obviously happier with it.  Overall, I am thrilled with this product.",0

Very nice",5.0,"I have extremely frustrating skin with many issues. I have rosacea, prone to pimples, large pores, texture and random rashes that come and go from my rosacea. Ive been very happy with my other moisturizer for the last few years until my rosacea went wild. And even tho it was fragrance free it was irritating my skin. So I did some research and this moisturizer by la roche posey came up and it’s a good price so I tried it. I’m very impressed. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I hate to put it out in the world by my skin is looking better than it has in the last year. I will say, it isn’t a ‘glowy’ moisturizer, it doesn’t make you shiny. But it makes my skin very soft and it absorbs very well. It’s very creamy. If you have skin that gets irritated and is prone to break outs I think this is for you. My skin is happy for the first time in what feels like a long time.",4

It's next-level good",5.0,"I've heard about this for a while now & finally decided to give it a try. The very first time, I put it on my face, I could tell it was a different kind of moisturizer.(BTW, if you are experiencing ""pilling"" and flaking with this, I would verify the authenticity. I had no problems like that and my face was clean but not freshly washed. The next time I used it, I used sunscreen over it and had no problems either. Try checking with La Roche online to see if you can verify by the markings on the container.)PROS:--The texture is light but not thin. I didn't have to use but a pea-sized amount for each half of my face and another for my neck.-- No fragrance at all.-- It glides very easily onto the skin. After I applied it and let it rest for about a full minute, my skin was so soft that it felt a bit ""padded"". I couldn't feel the moisturizer because it had completely absorbed. BTW, the first time I used this, I purposely used nothing else - no Hyaluronic or toner or anything.-- The results are pretty incredible and I can use the phrase about my skin feeling soft as a baby's bottom!My face did have a very slight tingling after the first application. It wasn't unpleasant but I kept an eye on it just in case. It abated after a while. I was reading somewhere that the tingling could be due to either a sensitivity to the level of niacinamide or because my skin barrier is compromised. In any case, I did not have this problem with the next application.CON:--The outer box was unsealed and there was no foil or plastic seal protecting the lotion. This made me hesitate and I wonder if other users had a seal or not. My tube seemed a bit flat also - like there might be some cream missing.OVERALL: This is a straight win & I will even call it a holy grail product. Even in between applying this moisturizer, I feel like I have had a fresh facial, an exfoliation, some serum, and a moisturizer. Since this worked so well, the only other thing I wanted to test was how long the hydration lasts. On the first day, I put it on as soon as I got the package (at about 5 pm) and decided to see if my face was still moisturized when waking the next morning. The result? Yes, my face was just as supple and hydrated as when I went to sleep. It's humid here and I usually end up wiping moisturizers and sunscreens off while constantly patting my face dry. I am not having to reapply this, no matter how many times I blot my face during the day.I have already ordered the version with SPF but went direct to the U.S. site. I don't like that my tube seemed not to be quite full. There was no safety seal so I have no idea if it was used or what. Plus, I get samples if I buy from the official site.My 62nd birthday is today and while I have good skin, I am getting those little dark ""freckles"" (aka age spots! LOL), and just after a few days of using this, my skin looks and feels more supple and healthy. I can almost swear the age spots are getting less noticeable!",170
