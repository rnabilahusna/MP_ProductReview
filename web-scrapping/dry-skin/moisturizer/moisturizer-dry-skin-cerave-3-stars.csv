OK",3.0,"I recently purchased the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion and while it does a decent job of moisturizing my dry skin, I wouldn't say it's a must-have product. The lotion has a nice, lightweight consistency and absorbs quickly, but I didn't find it to be any more hydrating than other lotions I've used in the past. Additionally, the fragrance-free formula has a slightly medicinal smell which I didn't enjoy.On the plus side, I appreciate that the lotion contains hyaluronic acid and ceramides, which are known to help strengthen the skin barrier. And the 12-ounce bottle is a great value for the price.All in all, I would give CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion a 3 out of 5 stars. It does the job of moisturizing, but it's not exceptional and the smell is not pleasant for me.",0

I've been using quite often and I'm not sure why I'm just now fully analyzing the ingredients; this contains 2 forms of parabens (methylparaben and propylparaben). I get the they are added in effort to help extend the shelf life of this lotion however, I will not continue the use of this product, after knowing the potential side effects of using products containing parabens.",2

Mixed emotions, something's fishy",3.0,"I bought this back in October of 2021 and barely used it all this time because although it is quite moisturizing it has, as some others have noted, a strange fishy smell. I thought it was just me as when smelling it from the bottle the odor didn't seem to be there. Nonetheless, I hate to waste it/the money so I think I'll apply to my legs before sleep, but will never put it on my face again. I'm not sure if it's acclimation but it seems like the smell hasn't lasted on my legs. I noted concerns about CeraVe being bought by L'oreal back in 2017 and the quality since but I'm unsure of what would have caused this issue for some and not others. I don't know if it's a bad batch or if I can't trust the main Amazon seller that I purchased it from. Either way, it's all cause for concern and I'm apt to purchase in-store to be safe, but am weary if this is just the smell of the formula. In any case, what's causing it?",5

No directions on the bottle on whether it needs to be turned to be unlocked or not.  There is an anti-pump clamp on the bottle you have to remove first.

Good “Drugstore” Product",3.0,"I took away a star! I’ve decided this is not the moisturizer for my sensitive skin!! CereVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a moderately good moisturizer but not a great moisturizer. It’s claim to fame is that it contains ceramides. That’s a desirable ingredient but you can find that ingredient in lots of products. A plus is the fragrance is nonexistent to very mild. What I didn’t like about it was I found it to be stingy on my face. My skin isn’t super sensitive but occasionally reacts to some products. I’m no longer using it for my face and have switched to Vanicream.  On my body the CereVe works fine with no stinging and found it to be very adequate, moisturizing without leaving a greasy feel.",0

After a year of comparing ......",3.0,"I compared this lotion....I like CeraVe products really.....and The Body Shop Rose hand cream. I am 75 so obviously my skin tends to be dry and wrinkly....getting old sux! I don't recommend it, lol!  Soooo here are the results for me. Both products are good....better than the average hand lotions imo...and both cover well. The DIFFERENCE I notice is after applying then. My skin returns to its wrinkly sort of dry appearance about 5 minutes after using CeraVe. NOT SO WITH ROSE LOTION. My skin stays moist much longer and LOOKS SMOOTHER much much longer which, imo, is all one can reasonably expect from an inexpensive hand cream. Its price and size are good and I keep a bottle in the bath, by the kitchen sink, and at my desk. it's definitely worth buying this to see if you get the same results.",4

UPDATE: Bad smell after it absorbs :-(",3.0,"UPDATE: I still really like this moisturizer, however I recently discovered a rather unsavory detail that I think buyers should be aware of: once it dries on your skin, it smells really bad. I didn't know because I can't smell it on my own face (it seems to go on with no fragrance), but I let my boyfriend use it one night, and when leaning in for a smooch, oh my gosh the smell is like a burnt plastic/ chemical-y/ almost fishy smell. Ugh. I think I will try Vanicream or La-Roche Posay instead.My dermatologist recommended the PM version of this moisturizer, but I noticed this one has very similar ingredients at a much more affordable price and volume. I have been looking for a favorite lotion to stick with for my face. I love it! It is so, so light and soothing. My face tends to be very sensitive and prone to redness and the occasional breakout but this lotion has never been irritating. I use it every night, and in the daytime I use Cerave with SPF. I highly recommend you buy this lotion if you have sensitive skin!",0

Didn't work for me",3.0,"I bought this back in August 2020 because I was in need of a light yet moisturizing lotion that I could use after my retinol and glycolic acids; or even as a basic facial lotion. And while it is safe to use with said exfoliators, it didn't do much in terms of actually being a hydrating lotion. I was really hoping it would be hydrating, so I waited until now to give my opinion. But even using it with toners didn't seem to make a difference, my skin would still feel and look rather dry after using the lotion. Perhaps this would work for others, but it didn't do anything for me. I have also tried other CeraVe products with rather similar disappointing results.",3

Soft, smooth skin in winter.",3.0,"I broke down and bought this even though it has parabens in it because I have acne and the acne.org boards and the acne product I use (Arithmetic) recommend it. My skin was drying out on my face from the benzoyl peroxide and the harsh, dry winter. I usually don't use anything with parabens, but I was desperate.  I have to use it very lightly on my face otherwise it's a grease pit. I just rub it all over my hands and then press a light amount into my face (to avoid removing the acne product that I put on first).  I haven't noticed anything too great on my face. But for my body......  After the first use my elbows were baby butt soft. I think I've already used half a bottle in a week!  My shins are no longer itchy or flaky and when I shaved my legs yesterday, I noticed an immediate difference in the way the razor moved across my skin.I'm only giving it 3 stars for 2 reasons. One is because of the two parabens in the product. I contacted the company via Facebook and they stated that they have no plans to remove the parabens (they will eventually, watch).  The second reason is that I expected more for my facial skin. I thought it might soften some of my fine lines a bit like others had mentioned.

This is first time I've ever ordered anything in pump bottle where pump didn't work right out of the box.  If manuf is reading this please tell me easiest way to get new pump.

Was great for my sensitive skin and not scented, however the moisturizer aspect just wasn’t there. I find myself applying this lotion and then an hour later feeling just as dry as I did before. Especially on my feet and hands. I won’t be purchasing this particular product again however I love love love most CeraVe products.",2

Not moisturizing",3.0,"Frankly, don't understand all the hype. You judge a moisturizer by its moisturizing effect. This product has none. Use it twice a day, but skin is still itchy and dry. Prior to CeraVe I used Cetaphil. That, is very moisturizing. Even if I didn't use it consistently, skin's moisture level would still sustain. Very disappointed.",0

Potential Flushing",3.0,"I was excited to purchase this CeraVe Moisturizing lotion for my skincare routine as many reviewers have had good experiences. Unfortunately, it has lead to an unpleasant experience for me.I first tried the lotion while applying my acne treatment. This left my face feeling quite hot to a bothersome level. I soon realized online that this is a bit common. I then decided to try it after 24 hours of my treatment. I have experienced the same result as last night.I then proceed to try it on my legs after waiting a few hours of shaving. This has also lead to a flushing experience where I had to soak it off due to the uncomfortable nature. I believe my skin is sensitive to a certain chemical or a combination of them in this product.It's always good to test patch. This product will work for the majority of people, but beware of possible sensitivity and flushing.",38

Okay Product",3.0,"This lotion is just okay. I bought it as a nightly face moisturizer since its very light. It was hydrating at first but now in the winter months my cheeks are starting to feel a little rough from the wind and dry air. This lotion doesn't seem to be doing much. There are more natural products that are more powerful and beneficial for the face.I did not breakout which is a plus. I have very acne prone skin, and this did not make it worse---but it did not make it better either. A lot of zits felt dry and flakey (as gross as that is) which is not good for acne either. Dryness only makes the face produce more oils--so a good moisturizer is something I need. I do want to venture out to different options because this was neither good nor bad, and I want something that will help my acne/ acne scars when this lotion kind of just sat there on my faceI would not buy again, unless other moisturizers I find break my skin out.... if that be the case I will run back to this one",2

Good for body, not for face",3.0,"Odd but it is AMAZING at moisturizing my body, yet leaves my face feeling very dry (I have healthy combo skin). I will still apply this to my (damp) face for the beneficial ingredients but I add a light later of Vaseline to hydrate and not feel like my skin is going to crack apart.Tip - I like to apply this to my body when I get out of the shower and I'm still damp. It spreads further and makes your skin REALLY soft. No scent to it and other than facial dryness/tightness, no adverse reaction.",0

Only thing I dislike how it was packaged it did not have any plastic seals on the 3 bottles so the product would not get  tampered with.

Bothered my skin.",3.0,"After hearing about ceramide on a (doctor's) talk show, I wanted to give it a try.  Based on reviews, I thought I would give CeraVe a try.  What sold me was that it was Non-comedogenic. Well, sadly, not for me.  Just using a pea size amount for my face, I seriously broke out, and they were not the tiny little whitehead kind!  I had a zit on my cheek  and 4 more on the chin area.  Wow.  I kept with it, hoping it was hormones or something.  Nope, as I am writing this, I now have 3 more.  So, safe to say, I am done with this product.  What I did like about it:  It absorbs nicely into the skin, does not feel greasy, and my skin (where I did not have acne) felt smooth.  I typically have an occassional zit.  Normal skin, but a little bit more dry in the winter months.The only thing that changed in my routine was this product.",7
