Bad packing",4.0,"The product itself is great; however, when I picked up the box from Whole Foods it was rattling around in the box...no paper, no plastic, no bubble wrap just a  plastic container rolling around in a big box.  When I opened it the pump was off and when I tried to put it back on, I noticed the cap was chipped so the pump would not stay on.  It would have been quite messy to return it so I bought a new screw pump.  As I said, the lotion itself is great!!!",0

Effective",4.0,"Senior here with thinning, itchy, allergy/dermatitis prone skin.  After a month of using Cera Ve Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin I’ve had no major itchy skin episodes.  The product does a relatively good job of retaining moisture in the skin.  The formula is easily spread and contains no discernible fragrance.  Used in combination with a small amount of Cera Ve’s Itch Relief Oil Cream it adequately relieves localized itchy skin flareups.  Like most of the brand’s eczema and itch relief products, it's best absorbed on damp skin immediately following bath or shower, otherwise it tends to feels like it’s just sitting on the surface of the skin.  I recommend this product to help lock in moisture to relieve dry, itchy skin.",11

Lightweight and long lasting",4.0,"This is a great moisturizer for someone that wants a really simple routine. It’s not irritating at all and scent-free. I have sensitive and oily skin and this doesn’t make it worse or interfere in any way. However, the price is what I’m not ecstatic about. It’s gotten more and more expensive over the years, so I might possibly consider looking for a new alternative if it keeps increasing in price. For now, it is and has been my most reliable option. A little goes a long way when applying as well!",7

My best experience with facial lotions. But not specifically designed for oily skin",4.0,"My skin definitely leans toward the oily side. And, being 17, it is acne prone. And even though I'm loving my Thayer's Rose Witch Hazel Toner, and it makes my skin incredibly soft, I still felt like I needed a moisturizer in my regimen.I have been using the CeraVe foaming cleanser for almost a year now. It is without a doubt my favorite cleanser, more so than CetaPhil or any other. It is often recommended by dermatologists, and that was good enough for me. I love it. Having tried a few facial moisturizers before and them all leaving my oily skin feeling greasier, I thought ""I should try CeraVe, I love their cleanser."" I have complete faith in this company, and the reviews (even reviews from oily-skinned people) made this stuff sound amazing.I was very excited to try this. After my toner dried into my skin, feeling very soft, I took almost a full pump of this (as that is what I do with the CeraVe cleanser) and applied it to my face. And...my skin felt like it had lotion on it. My hand dragged across my skin, sticking lightly to it. My face couldn't feel anything on it, which was nice, but my hand could feel a not-as-soft texture as my toner gives me. I thought ""It just needs to soak in, I'll see how it feels in the morning"" Slept on it...nope, my skin is still not as soft as my toner makes it. Hand still kind of drags across it. Definitely not as bad at all as my previous experiences with facial moisturizers, but still, not nearly as optimistic as I was when I got it.Feeling that since I bought it, I have to at least give it a better chance then just one use, I put it on again that morning, but only used about a half of a pump. Face can't feel the lotion on it, but my hand still is dragging a little on that lotion texture. And a few hours later, my nose is a bit oilier than it normally is. Not horrible, but still not encouraging.The next time I use it, I barely pump any of it and spread it all around my face. And it sinks in completely within maybe 15 minutes, A lot better results, it leaves my skin softer than the previous two uses. Not feeling as lotion-y.I will update in a couple of weeks to see if I like this enough to keep in my regimen. But it currently seems that, as it says on the label, this is made for normal to dry skin, and if you lean on the oily side like me, you're going to be able to use less of this for better results.",0

CeraVe Lotion is Great!  Delivery Packaing is a Problem",4.0,"I love this lotion!  It's immediately moisturizing and not sticky!!!  My two favorite things about lotions.  I give 5 stars for the product.  The lack of securing the screw top so it doesn't unscrew during shipping is a problem.

If the pump doesn't pump.....",4.0,"I will focus on the issue many have, including me, of the pump on a new bottle NOT working.The pump just turns freely without a stop and doesn't pump. And yes, I tried all the obvious and natural things to do as with any such pump.I phoned Customer Service and was told this:""Tap the bottom of the container three times"".  (She did NOT say ""Make a wish."")""Then twist the top in the direction marked ""Open"".""IT WORKED!!!Now the pump works as it should.  She tried to explain  exactly why this works, but I didn't follow her explanation.I suspect it is something like Tech Support telling you to unplug your device. count to ten. then plug it back in --- which reboots and resets the device.  So basically ""operator error"".--------------------------------------Regarding the product itself...My Dermatologist recommended it to me. He told me it is the best moisturizing lotion out there. (I did not ask him if he had stock in the company.)He also said the best way to use it is to wet your skin first, then TAP the skin with a towel to remove most of the water. THEN put the lotion on your damp skin. He said that helps the product get absorbed.I tried it and it does work better that way.I highly recommend this product.I gave it four stars only because of the pump problems which several reviewers have mentioned, including me.",3

Good for summer, too watery for winter",4.0,"The only thing I love more than a good moisturizer is a good deal so when I found this cheap but well reviewed lotion I had to buy it. Unfortunately, this lotion didn’t totally live up to my expectations. I have a generally normal skin type and use lotion every day after a shower. This stuff works well if you live in a humid climate and it’s hot enough out for the relative humidity to actually keep moisture in your skin. Unfortunately that isn’t everyone all the time always. I think that this lotion would work well in tandem with another heavier lotion to use during the winter or during times of dry skin. I personally think the cream version of this lotion is great. It is thick enough to not spill everywhere but goes on quickly. I probably won’t buy this lotion again.",0

Not good for acne prone skin.",4.0,"I bought this lotion for my back and chest since I get acne in those areas and needed something that wouldn't clog my pores. This lotion was recommended by some skincare youtube videos so I thought it would be a good choice, especially since it says on the bottle that it's ""non-comedogenic and won't clog pores"".I started to breakout more after using it... so I decided to get a list of pore clogging ingredients and read through the ingredient list on the back of the bottle.It lists cetearyl alcohol as the 4th ingredient and ceteareth-20 as the 12th ingredient. Apparently those ingredients on their own are fine but if they are in the same product, they will clog your pores. They don't have to be listed back to back either. The last ingredient is polyglyceryl-3-diisostearate which also clogs pores.I heard that companies can make claims like ""non-comedogenic"" and ""won't clog pores"" because those statements aren't regulated by the FDA. Which would make sense since this product definitely broke me out and has ingredients that aren't good for acne sufferers. So I would recommend reading ingredients before making a purchase for any product.I will continue to use this lotion for other areas but not where I break out. It does moisturize and doesn't have a scent.",3

Works well on dry skin",4.0,I bought this because I recently have tried the CeraVe body cream (love it) and wanted to compare it with this body lotion.  I have used Lubriderm for many years and wanted to compare it with that also.  It is very hydrating and keeps my very dry skin moisturized.  With Lubriderm I have to reapply a few times throughout the day.  With the CeraVe lotion only needs one application and it lasts all day long.,2

Good product, Recommend. Sensitive Skin, Acne",4.0,"My skin breaks out from everything so I am always afraid to try new products but I have heard a lot of good things about this brand so I gave it a go, and it has worked really well! It has not caused my face to break out and it keeps it moisturized. A little goes a long way, just need a small dab and it covers my whole face and neck. It is also very light weight and doesn't really smell like much. Nothing overpowering and it doesn't smell medicine like. I honestly can't even remember if it has a smell haha which is a good thing right?  My boyfriend also uses this for his eyelids (weird, I know haha) because they get super dry, and he says it helps a lot! It doesn't burn or anything when they are super dry. I will continue to use this as my moisturizer as long as my skin allows me to :)",0

Great for sensitive skin",4.0,"Got this for my grandmother after trying over a dozen different moisturizers. Not one helped her with her sensitive skin, but this one did the trick. It keeps skin soft, has caused no irritation, and has been fantastic for her. She loves it because it doesn't even make her hands oily. I would highly recommend it. The trick is to use less than you think you need, and it lasts a lifetime.",2

Smells like Grandma’s makeup bag.",4.0,"So upon first use I can tell you right now. It stinks. Man, oh man.. It stinks. After applying to my face the scent lingers for a few hours. The best way I can accurately describe this scent is... it smells like the inside of grandma’s old makeup bag. So maybe it can bring you a little nostalgia. But it IS advertised as “no fragrance” which means no pretty chemical smells. A lot of dermatologists recommend using no fragrance products because it can cause allergic reactions to some people with sensitive skin conditions, however no fragrance means we get the smell of the actual ingredients. It’s not oily like other lotions and it dries quick. So you won’t get a caked on feeling. To be honest. I will probably still use this because of how well it makes my skin look and feel. I will not be using this in the morning, only at night because this smell is pretty bad. But in my opinion, it’s worth putting up with in order to have healthy young looking skin.",0

Worked fine but have switched brands",4.0,"My dermatologist recommend this brand and I used it for a long time for keeping down minor psoriasis, which it could do for two or three weeks before I had to use medication again. It also worked great on dry, bumpy arms. However, at one point I couldn't find it locally and ordered it online. While waiting, I switched to Eucerin Advanced Repair and that has been amazing. I no longer need to use my medication to keep down the psoriasis flares at all, going on a few months now. So if using this for psoriasis, you might consider trying the other brand and see if it works for you.Also, I would not recommend using CeraVe on the face if you have sensitive skin! But it does work great on arms and legs.",0

Excellent moisturizer for dry legs. Immediate help for dry skin.",4.0,"I suffered from very dry skin particularly on my legs and feet. It itched terribly, even keeping me up at night. I tried other lotions, with varying success but nothing actually solved the problem. But, I tried CeraVe and was surprised that it actually helped right away. Honestly, I had given up on lotions helping, since they tended to need reapplication - and I am a bit lazy. But this product gave me  just enough all day moisturizing to take away the itch! Now, I use it right after showering daily, and highly recommend IF you suffer from dry itchy skin.",0

I was so disappointed to see it packaged with nothing to stop it from bouncing around in the box, no plastic over the pump so lotion wouldn't come out as it did inside the box.  I really just wanted another bottle to replace the lost lotion that moisturized the inside of the cardboard box in its travels to me.  I was offered a refund if I wasn't happy and the option to return the product.  So the leaking bottle could continue leaking back to Amazon?!

It's pretty good",4.0,"First of all I received CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion very quickly and in great condition.  The moisturizer works very well.  My face is usually greasy but during the winter it gets very dry and my Aveeno moisturizer which works great during the summer, doesn't work well for the cold season.  I bought this moisturizer after reading about it in a magazine and noticed how great it works as soon as I put it on without making my face greasy.  The only thing I really don't like about it is the smell.  It has a medicine smell to it that I personally don't like at all and it just lingers for a long time.  So needless to say I was torn on what to do because I love the way it helps take away the flakiness and tight feeling of my skin especially in the morning.  So I decided to mix just a little bit of my Aveeno positively ageless moisturizer (that I usually use during the summer which has a very pretty smell) with some of the CeraVe lotion and it worked out great!  My skin feels amazing without the medicine smell to it.  So if you are able to get past the medicine smell than I do recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion.",5

Good but maybe I need a more moisturizing lotion, this is too watery.",4.0,"Not going to lie I had high expectations for this, I've seen it dermatologist recommendations all over the place for years. But when I opened it up and tried it one day after showering, which is when my skin is the dryest, I felt like it wasn't as moisturizing as my previous lotion. In fact I felt like it had a very watery base. So my recommendation is get it if you have normal to oily skin because I did find that the next day my face was less oily than normal. But if you have really dry skin, this particular one isn't the one for you.",0

Excellent moisturizer",4.0,"This product must be first praised for everything it is not.  So many hyped skin care products contain known irritants which can not only cause immediate redness but long term can cause aging to the skin even when the user does not see the irritation as redness.  No volatile plant oils like orange or lavender.  No alcohol or witch hazel or any other ingredients known to cause irritation.  This fact alone separates this product from so many other uber-popular moisturizers.  But that's not where this product stops.  They've included many well-researched ingredients for the skin.  Just check this ingredient list and do a 5 minute internet research on these ingredients' effectiveness.  And if that were not enough, this product goes on light weight and almost doesn't feel like it is there, yet provides effective dry skin control.  So why only 4 stars when this product outshines almost everything at the drugstore and quite a few high end moisturizers? The manufacturers obviously did their skin ingredient research but they seemed to have forgotten the research on anti-oxidants.  Sadly, they neglected to include any in this product formulation.  Regardless, this product remains a great alternative.  For use on the face as well!",5
