A Gentle and Effective Cleanser for Healthy Skin",5.0,"The CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser has become a staple in my skincare routine, and for good reason. This non-foaming face wash has proven to be a game-changer in maintaining my skin's health and hydration.What sets this cleanser apart is its gentle and moisturizing formula. It doesn't strip the skin of its natural oils or leave it feeling tight and dry like some other cleansers. Instead, it effectively removes dirt, makeup, and impurities while providing a boost of hydration.The key ingredients, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and glycerin, work harmoniously to lock in moisture and strengthen the skin's natural barrier. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall appearance since incorporating this cleanser into my daily regimen.Fragrance-free and paraben-free, this cleanser is suitable for even the most sensitive skin types. It doesn't irritate or cause any adverse reactions, making it a reliable choice for those with delicate or reactive skin.The generously-sized 16-fluid ounce bottle ensures that a little goes a long way, making it an economical option that lasts for months.I particularly appreciate the practical pump dispenser, as it makes the application mess-free and convenient, especially during my morning rush.After each use, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and comfortably hydrated, ready to absorb the benefits of the following skincare steps. It has also contributed to reducing occasional breakouts, leaving me with a clearer and more radiant complexion.CeraVe is a brand known for its dermatologist-recommended products, and this facial cleanser is no exception. It has earned my trust with its science-backed formulation and the positive impact it has had on my skin's health.In conclusion, the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is a top-notch product that lives up to its promises. With its gentle yet effective cleansing action, it keeps my skin hydrated, supple, and ready to face the day.

Amazing product.",5.0,I swapped to this after cetaphil changed their ingredients for their face wash. It's amazing leaves your face feeling fresh and moisturized after a shower. Most importantly it does not cause any acne break outs for me. Doesn't really have a scent.Thanks Cerave for picking up the ball when cetaphil dropped it.,14

Good for your skin, dermatologist recommended.",5.0,This is a wonderful product. I've been using it for years now and I tell you the ads for this product is not a hollow advertisement. It really protects and moisturizes your skin. You can wash every day your face with it with total confidence.,4

Skincare Staple For a Reason",5.0,"I keep coming back to this unassuming cleanser every time my skin gets the winter blues. For reference:I have oily, combination, with dry patches (overusing tretinoin 0.1) skin and I love heavy skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. So I use Embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as I felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault I’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so I started switching to gentler products, taking a page from French skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better. So I randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. I tried it for a few days and I HATED it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. So I did with it what I did with other hated products—I put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. But, after a year or so I decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from YouTube derms. And I decided to actually give it a try. Because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.After trying a few weeks I loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. It would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. My skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like Sahara Desert. It really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that I know MY skin can use during the colder months. I never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. It soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight. The only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, I use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. I usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so I can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. I’m used to it now not lathering and I’m fine with it. You can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. I’m a convert believer!",11

A Gentle Savior for My Sensitive Skin",5.0,"I’ve been searching for a gentle yet effective facial cleanser for my sensitive skin, and CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser has been a game-changer.

Interesting consistency but works!!",5.0,"Ok so…I’m just gonna say it. I hate the way this product feels on my face while I’m using it. With that aside, it’s the only thing that works for me really really well. I usually use the original one (one that isn’t moisturizing) but accidentally picked this one up when I ran out. The colors of the bottles are similar and I just made a mistake. I remember washing my face with this and it feeling like straight…sploog. I hate that it feels like you’re rubbing lotion all over your face! Ugh. But I got used to it and honestly, it’s the best face wash I’ve ever had. My breakouts are completely cleared. I didn’t even know I had a problem with dry skin until I started using this. My face is bouncy now. I’m glowing. I’m THAT girl. So for the money, it’s worth a shot!! Buy it and be disgusted and impressed like me! :)",4

Great ingredients-compared to department stores",5.0,"I found this by watching a few dermatologists I trust on YouTube. It has to be the most affordable drug store brand that offers all the same benefits of $200 products, from the cleansers, lotions, spf tint facial lotion, I have them all. I grew up in the tanning bed era 😩 so now it’s all about playing catch up with good products without going for the needles (maybe one day) 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m  happy with all their products & for the prices I plan to stick with them. I have a few other serums I use, but being reasonably priced without harsh alcohols etc & more preventative ingredients added in compared to other brands sold me. My skin looks great!",0

Great for extra dry skin during the winter",5.0,"I use this during the winter as advised by my Derm for my extra dry skin.When I was trying to get my skin back on track after using some overly expensive products by a plastic surgeon (who also creates content) that messed up my skin, I went to a dermatologist. I had this in the stash and asked her about it and she said to use during the winter because my skin gets VERY, VERY dry during the winter. I’ve been using this since.It’s thick and doesn’t have a scent.",0

It gently cleansed without the dramatic lather, ensuring my skin's barrier wasn't disrupted.Ceramides & Company: I loved that it's packed with essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid, fortifying my skin's natural barrier and locking in moisture.Sensitive Skin Symphony: With its fragrance-free formulation, my sensitive skin sang praises. No more redness or irritation post-cleansing!The Moisture Musings:Texture Twist: If you're used to foamy cleansers, the creamy texture might take a bit of getting used to.

used for over a year and finally reviewing",5.0,"Skincare reviews are hard to be trusted. Many people write reviews after a few days or a couple of weeks of using the skincare. Often people are writing reviews before their skin has fully adjusted to the product. Also there are a lot of questionable ethics that some of these lesser known companies are using so long story short - if the skincare product is highly rated on amazon but you've never heard of it - GOOGLE THE BRAND and look for FORUMS and not review sites - forums have people who are passionate about skincare having lengthy discussions and that's where you find the most honest info. It is possible for an item to be a ""verified purchase"" but isn't truly an honest review. A lot of people make money as full time reviewers so the more reviews they have, the more brands will want to work with them, and brands don't want to see a lot of negative reviews. Sorry to ramble, I just feel bad for people who buy into the hype of some of these ""amazon famous"" brands that are mediocre at best.This is great for dry skin. It took me about 6 months to stop hating it. Until about 30, my skin was an oil well, so I always used cleansers that were foaming. So as I got older and my skin got drier and drier, I continued to use the foaming cleansers for the squeaky clean feeling. Well it turns out that squeaky clean feeling was actually my skin being stripped of oil... which may have been ok when my skin was an oil well but was not ok when my skin became naturally dry.  It was really hard to get used to this cleanser because I didn't ""feel"" anything. Like it didn't feel clean, and as I cleansed my skin with it I always thought ""is this removing ANY dirt from my face?"" But it was, I just wasn't used to my face not feeling dried out lol. For those who are asking why this may not be working or why your skin still feels dry after washing you may want to read up on hyaluronic acid. It is known as a moisturizing ingredient HOWEVER, the way it works is that it moisturizes your face by pulling moisture from the air - so if it's winter and your environment is super dry with the heat vents OR if you live in a dry climate, this still can work really well - just make sure you put on a really great moisturizer after washing your face so that the hyaluronic acid pulls the moisture from there to deposit it on your skin. And also use google because I'm just a chick who read some articles, not a profesh!! SO ANYWAY, the Cerave brand is great and this purchase is well worth it. I spent all of my 20s wasting exorbitant money on skincare until I discovered ingredient lists and skincare forums - isn't it funny how we get so duped into thinking expensive=better? It was mind blowing when I found out that most of the drugstore products have the exact same order of ingredients as their overpriced counter parts. Ok sorry for rambling so much bye.",20

How I got rid of my acne",5.0,"The cleanser is gentle on my skin and doesn't irritate it. For years I had pretty bad acne that gave me moon craters. I thought it was the product I was using so I kept switching. Then I started educating myself and found out there were a few reasons for my acne. The biggest culprit was SUGAR! It didn't matter what I was putting on my face, the problem was internal.I love chocolates and ice-cream but my skin did not. After a few months of TLC, my skin started to heal and look better. I think my acne cleared up because of a combination of using cerave products, cutting down my sugar intake, and NOT TOUCHING MY FACE. Touching my face was probably another culprit of my acne. Whenever I touched my face, whatever invisible dirt or germs I had on my finger would be transferred to my face.When my acne was bad, I started using this cleanser twice a day along with with la roche posay salicylic acid (exfoliant) in the morning and cerave moisturizer. Now that my skin is clear, I only use the cleanser once a day, I stopped using the exfoliant as I felt I no longer needed it, and I use the moisturizer twice a day after I rinse/wash my face. I know sugar is definitely a factor because pimples start popping up again whenever my sugar intake increases. Having a sweet tooth, I didn't cut out sugar completely, I only limited my intake. This wasn't much of a review, just wanted to share what I learnt. I highly suggest finding out what works for you.",57
