Hydrating, soft skin, but not good with eye makeup",3.0,This product does wonders for making my skin feel so soft and moisturized. But I do not feel it does a good job cleansing and removing makeup/doing a deep clean. So I will use this as my second wash.,0

Gentle face cleanser",3.0,"Aesthetician recommended this brand to me for my acne prone skin and gave me a sample size to take home. I was given dry to extra dry and couldn't locate that one on amazon, so I decided to try normal to dry instead listed above. I gave this three stars because even though this wash is gentle, it seems like it does not thoroughly cleanse my face like the sample I was given. Product seems to just glide over skin instead of absorbing. I have noticed its somewhat more moisturizing than other cleansers out there but I haven't noticed an improvement overall.",0

It’s okay",3.0,"First time trying it, and it’s okay. I have dry and sensitive skin. I don’t really like how it feels. It doesn’t feel like I’m cleansing anything on my face. Probably won’t buy again and stick to my cetaphil cleanser.",0

Does not foam",3.0,"This soap is great because it has no harsh chemicals and is special for sensitive skin, but it does not foam, so I sometimes don't feel like it really cleaned my face.

Smells more like chemicals now",3.0,"I’ve been using this face wash for years, and it’s always had an “unscented lotion” subtle smell. I bought it at Target months ago and the cleanser smelt off, like chemicals for cleaning a hot tub. I threw it away and ordered one here on Amazon and it had the same strong smell! Ughh. I don’t know what’s up with these recent batches. It’s not mold or a expired sour smell, it’s like too much of a chemical",2

Light cleanser with no fragrance",3.0,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and said it was safe for sensitive skin.

Not Really a Makeup Remover",3.0,"My skin as gotten dryer and decided to purchase the cream for sensitive skin instead of the usual gel washs that I typically use. I was excited to try a product that seemed to be more of a professional product instead of a drugstore brand.I also knew that it would  clean face and eye makeup not only because the description stated that it would, but also because it is a cream based cleanser, which sould emulsify mascara and eyeliner easily.The product felt great on my face and it did loosen the face makeup and most of the eye makeup. However, once I went to wipe my face with a warm washcloth to remove everything, my mascara, just smeared. So, I used another pump did the process again, giving the eye makeup extra attention. Again, it only removed a portion of the remaining eye makeup. Still, the regular NON-Waterproof mascara was smeared and adheared to skin of my upper and lower lids.I've only used it for the one cleaning. Because of the other great reviews, I'm going to give it another try. Maybe let it sit in place a.little longer before rinsing?. Yet, if I don't see better results, I'll have to return.",0

Doesn't really cleanse",3.0,"This product is gentle and sensitive. Unfortunately it's so gentle it doesn't really do much to actually cleanse the face. It barely touches eye makeup even if I put coconut oil on beforehand and it won't wash off any foundation or concealer. If I wash my face with this and then wipe with a toner, the toner takes off a ton of makeup the face wash misses. I've been washing my face with Dove soap to actually remove makeup and dirt, then using this cleanser as an additional wash. If your skin is fairly clean, this cleanser seems to do a fairly good job of doing a final wash. But don't expect it to remove makeup or dirt.",6

Good - but not for me",3.0,"I have sensitive and somewhat dry skin but it looks good with light freckles, very minimal lines and no wrinkles (I am in my early 60s). My skin care routine consists washing my face every night with micellar water then a gentle cleanser, sunblock (CeraVe AM 30 spf) every morning under my makeup (higher SPF in the summer or if outdoors), and nightly moisturizers (heavier in the winter and lighter in the summer) since I was 16. Hat in the sun, no smoking etc. That's it - 10 minutes max a day and nothing fancy - just taking consistent good care of it. I have been using Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash for years but decided to try La Roche-Posay Gentle Cleanser thinking I should mix things up and based on the many positive reviews. Sorry but just not the same for me... La Roche-Posay does not do as good a job in removing eye or face make-up (I really don't wear much) and it left my face feeling a bit tighter. My sensitive skin did not show any reaction which was good news. However, i will be returning to my trusty Purpose once I have finished up with this bottle of La Roche-Posay. Sometimes, new isn't better...",2

I don’t understand all the rave reviews!",3.0,"I bought this product as a temporary replacement to a Bioderma Atoderm cleanser that was out of stock, and I really am not experiencing the wonderful results everyone else seems to be having. It does a very, very poor job at removing makeup and requires several applications and scrubbing with a wash cloth, which is irritating to the skin. It’s especially terrible at removing anything near the eye area if you are wearing eye makeup. Does not break down makeup at all - just smears it in dark patches around your eyes and makes it even more difficult to remove. Had to get a separate eye makeup remover. Can’t wait to go back to the other product.",2

Just okay...",3.0,"This doesn't make me break out or anything, but I won't be purchasing again. It feels like it leaves a film on my face and doesn't completely cleanse. I used some on my face and neck in the shower, and after as a test I rubbed a small area of my neck with an alcohol swab - it was still brown with dirt/dead skin (I don't wear makeup), so I don't feel like this cleanser is actually cleaning much off. I wish it foamed a little so I could better tell where I've washed. Also I feel like I have to use more of this than other facewashes to cover my whole face - it just doesn't spread easily or something.",0

Feels more like cream",3.0,"Does it clean my face? Sure? There is absolutely zero texture in this soap. I know it's not supposed to be textured or an exfoliant, but it lathers really oddly. It feels more like a cream when I wash my face. WITH THAT SAID, my face does feel great and its doing the job quite amazingly. This is huge step up from bar soap.",0

Just ok",3.0,"Eh. This is an ok option for dry, sensitive skin but it doesn’t remove make up or even spf ( especially mineral) very well all all. Suitable for a second Step in a double cleanse with the first step being an oil based cleanser. I ended up buying cerave cream to foam cleanser instead and preferred that much better. Still trying to use this up so it’s not a total waste of money but I will not be repurchasing for sure.",0

Meh. Not moisturizing from someone with dry skin",3.0,"As 40ish woman with dry maturing skin (+ psoriasis) I'm a pretty good judge of products that claim to be moisturizing. I had high expectations from this product based on the great reviews and awesome ingredients.THE GOODIt's very affordable for a big quantity that I expect would last a long time with daily use. I also appreciate that it comes with a pump.It does an excellent job removing sunscreen and makeup (including mascara), which (as far as I'm concerned) is the most important task of a cleanser. If it doesn't remove makeup (ahem, I'm looking at you Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser) it's not really a cleanser, amiright?THE BADWhile I don't necessarily find it stripping or leaving my skin with a tight feeling after cleansing, I also don't find it at all moisturizing as others have reported. I have to follow up very quickly with my moisturizers otherwise I can really feel the water loss in my skin. It will probably be an acceptable cleanser for my skin in the summer when it is more humid.BOTTOM LINEIf you have more oily skin, I think you will find this a very gentle and satisfying cleanser. If you're like me with dry skin looking for a hydrating cleanser in winter, skip this and go with something like DHC Cleansing Oil or another oil-based cleanser. If you are dazzled by the reviews like I was and REALLY want to try this, I recommend purchasing first from big box store that will easily accept a return if you don't care for it. Then if you love it, repurchase from Amazon. Best wishes!",12

Does NOT remove makeup",3.0,"It’s gentle. Doesn’t have a strong smell. Low cost. Easy pump dispenser. Seems good, but it doesn’t remove makeup! And I’m not taking about eye makeup or stubborn waterproof makeup. Nope. I am talking about general makeup. I used it to wash my face at night but my face didn’t feel clean so I used a cleansing wipe from another brand to wipe my face to test it, and so much makeup came off on the wipe after washing! I use Two Faced Born this Way foundation, BTW. It’s long wearing but not waterproof. A cleanser should remove this, and every cleanser I’ve ever used has removed my makeup with little effort. This doesn’t. So now I’m one of those wacky people who do the two-step cleansing routine. I now use Boscia Makeup Breakup Cleansing Oil, then I use this afterward. I don’t want to do this. It defeats the purpose of using a low-cost cleanser since now I have to buy two cleansers so my price for this routine is way more than I want to pay, plus it takes longer adding the step. Pros are that it’s a big bottle and cheap. But I don’t like that it doesn’t remove makeup and I don’t like the feel of it (like watered down lotion). It doesn’t foam, and I get why, but it doesn’t lather at all and takes getting use to. Not sure I’ll repurchase. I don’t understand the reviews that claim it does remove makeup, because this was certainly not the case for me.",8

It's okay, but not the facewash for me",3.0,"I tried this out because I heard this was similar but better than Cetaphil. It is better than Cetaphil for sure. Unlike Cetaphil, this cleanser didn't leave my skin feeling both dry and oily shortly after. I just don't think this is the best facewash for me. I have combination skin, and I don't feel this does enough to neutralize/prevent the oils on my T Zone. I guess as I'm aging my skin doesn't need sensitive formulas anymore. It may work great for others, though~",0

OK, but not my favorite",3.0,"The BEST thing about the LaRoche-Posay Cleanser is that it really does remove ALL make-up, including mascara!  Very impressed at how well it cleans my face.  I think this product would be perfect for ""sensitive"" skin as it is extremely gentle and lacks any type of fragrance or scent.  However, I do not find it to be ""hydrating or moisturizing"".  After using this product for the past two weeks, my skin is just as dry as before.  The product itself is rather ""thin"" - I would prefer a thicker feel to the product.  I would also appreciate a light scent and of course MORE hydrating/moisturizing properties.",0

Pretty decent",3.0,"So this did do it's job, it cleaned my skin and left it feeling moisturized. However, it felt like it left a film over my skin - this did not cause any breakouts so I didn't mind. I feel like the film helped it be hydrating.The downside came from the fact that while it's a gentle cleanser it made my skin reactive to other products. My whole face turned red and hot when I put on CeraVe lotion. I stopped using this cleanser and it went away. So that caused me to switch to vanicream gentle cleanser which I've had zero troubles from using. I don't like the idea of having to work around my face cleanser in order to find products that work well. I'm already desperate just to find good products, I'd hate to think I missed one bc my cleanser made me have a poor skin reaction.",0

It’s not super drying, but it’s not super effective at removing makeup like mine either. It would get most of the makeup off, but leave a thin film of makeup residue on my skin.

Wish I loved it",3.0,"I purchased this hoping for a hydrating face wash for sensitive/dry skin. I used this for about a month before I realized that it was what was causing my acne. I don’t usually suffer from acne but I noticed a significant increase in breakouts while using this product. It also caused some irritation and burning with use. I do use RetinA and had high hopes for this as it is moisturizing but unfortunately, I had to pass it onto my husband lol. I love this brand so I may try a different face wash.",0

Even though I use a lot, I still feel like I need more , it doesn’t go far at all. It doesn’t clean my skin how I usually like it, it takes more washes.

It looks like you have a ton but then when you go to use it the product doesn’t feel like it goes far on your skin at all. This tube will last half the time my normal wash does. It also doesn’t clean my skin at all. The only makeup I wear is eyeliner yet after washing my face with this and then wearing my (covid) face masks they come off looking so dirty. That has never happened prior to using this.",0

Not my favorite La Roche Posay face wash",3.0,"My skin can typically tolerate MOST face washes, whether sensitive or not. I also use Retinol on a regular basis which most of you know can be irritating. I bought this for my husband and decided to try it out. My thoughts: Hydrating yes. For sensitive skin? Not quite. Why does my skin feel a burning sensation afterwards? Maybe not the best choice for those who need a face wash for sensitive skin. Also I have a mediocre “clean” feeling after usage. Would I buy again? Most certainly not. I preferred the La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser. Better clean feeling, gentle enough with a clean scent.",5
