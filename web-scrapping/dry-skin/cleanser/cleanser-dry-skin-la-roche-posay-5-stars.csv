You found your next face wash",5.0,"I can't praise La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser enough! This product has completely transformed my skincare routine. The texture is incredibly smooth and gentle on my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and clean without any irritation. Unlike other cleansers, it doesn't strip away my skin's natural moisture, making it perfect for my sensitive skin.What truly sets this cleanser apart is its ability to remove makeup and impurities effectively. After using it, my skin feels soft, hydrated, and incredibly nourished. The hypoallergenic and fragrance-free formula gives me confidence that I'm taking care of my skin without any harsh chemicals.I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall hydration since I started using this cleanser. If you're looking for a cleanser that is not only gentle but also effective, La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser is definitely worth trying. I'm thrilled with the results and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a reliable, skin-friendly cleanser. Added bonus, itâ€™s reasonably priced",30

Great for dry, sensitive skin",5.0,"I had finally ran out of my 'usual' facial cleanser and decided I wanted to try something new. Among a few others, I chose this facial cleanser for some specific reasons. Number one: it's very gentle and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry after use. Number two: fair price, especially when compared to the multiple other cleansers available at all price points. Number three: I have a family member who used to work in a plastic surgeon's office and she said that the doctor absolutely loves products from this company, and he always had samples available which she of course tried for herself and loved.This cleanser is very creamy and does not lather (which is just fine - lather is not necessary to indicate a product is actually working or not). There is no detectable scent/fragrance. I apply it all over my face with my fingertips, then I use a Makeup Eraser type of cloth to go over my entire face and neck in a circular motion. Afterwards, my skin feels clean and soft and prepared for the rest of my skincare routine. I also got my boyfriend to start using it due to having rosacea and he finally got rid of his bar soap (yaaaayyy!). I can't say enough good things about this stuff, and I highly recommend it, especially if you have very sensitive skin, dryness, are post-procedural and need a gentle, effective cleanser. I give it â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† Hope my review helped someone make a more informed decision about buying it or not.",4

It leaves fase so moisturized!",5.0,I was so scared to buy this and spent a whole year waiting to do it because I have a very sensitive skin. Absolutely loved it. No harsh smell . Its not heavy itâ€™s just perfect . I canâ€™t stress this enough I wish I had gotten it before . I had this other brand that just made my skin burn ! I would use it only once in a while . But with this I use it everyday and itâ€™s just the best. I can see improvement in my skin tone which is crazy because I have only used it for a week and it cleans the skin perfectly! Like it literally takes the dirt of the skin!,4

My favorite face wash! Great for sensitive skin!",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Â Iâ€™ve been using this face wash for the past year and itâ€™s done my skin WONDERS !! ðŸ˜« My skin tends to be kinda dry but slightly oily in my t zone and around my nostrils. Iâ€™m also prone to breakouts, and anything scented tends to make things worse. I could never find a skincare routine that fully worked for me and made the breakouts stop. I was putting in SO MUCH WORK for little results, and then I started using this stuff and LET ME TELL YOU- MY SKIN HAS NEVER LOOKED/FELT SO GOOD !! At first, I noticed I was still dealing with some blemishes and almost stopped using this stuff cause I thought it was the face washâ€™s fault but it turns out itâ€™s because I wasnâ€™t using it properly (oops). Make sure to use a wash cloth when washing your face! I was uneducated and didnâ€™t realize that by not using a wash cloth, I was leaving some of the face wash trapped on my skin and it was clogging my pores and causing the pimples. So make sure to AT LEAST use a clean wash cloth when rinsing it off, if not for the entire wash and rinse process. Also, this doesnâ€™t just apply to this face wash, itâ€™s apparently common skincare knowledge that I was just unaware of (like I said, it wasnâ€™t the face washâ€™s fault yâ€™all)! I now am happy to say that I havenâ€™t had a breakout or uneven skin in many months. I make sure to use it twice a day, morning and night, and for me personally I apply Paulaâ€™s choice pore reducing toner with a cotton pad afterwards (use toner while your skin is still wet!) and then usually vitamin c serum, a couple drops of jojoba oil, and some spf on top during the day. I dab off any extra oiliness with a paper towel (donâ€™t rub the paper towel on your face itâ€™s not good for your poor sensitive skin ðŸ˜­) At night I wash my face, use the toner, and then some jojoba oil, rosehip seed oil, or The Ordinaryâ€™s 1% retinol in squalane depending on what I feel my skin needs (also if you wanna start using a retinol serum, I highly recommend doing some research first so you know what youâ€™re getting into/how often to use it!) overall, this stuff feels great on my face and isnâ€™t too thick and it doesnâ€™t leave any weird residue feeling like some face washes have in the past. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and balanced, no more dry or oily spots! I also love that the bottle is easy to take with me places because I travel a lot. It has a cool little c shaped clip that goes under the pump to keep it from leaking in your bag which is an honest lifesaver. The bottle is durable too/itâ€™s not about to get crushed in my bag under all my stuff. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this face wash for anyone with sensitive skin!!",56

Gentle cleanser for all skin types",5.0,I took a gamble on this product as I was deviating from my customary mens clinique products for over 20 years. I had been using the men's charcoal cleanser from that line ever since it came out. Still something was missing. I came across laroche products while doing some research and after the first usage I was sold.  It's been a good two weeks now and this will be my new go-to cleanser. It is gentle and very smooth. Non scented and doesn't lather up.  I used to have really oily skin as a younger man and would of loved to have this product too however I genuinely believe that this will be ideal for all skin types.  Overall 5 stars all across the board! Clinique has been good to me but switching over to this product for my main cleanser,2

I absolutely love this cleanser!",5.0,"I adore this cleanser. My skin feels so soft afterwards. I use a lot of active ingredients (like vitamin c, retinol, and acids) so my skin started flaking really bad which was surprising because I have oilier skin. Anyways I was reading somewhere that I should switch over to cream cleansers to help hydrate my skin. The idea of a cream cleanser felt kind of foreign because of my oily skin background but I still decided to try it out and am so happy I did. My skin feels nourished and is looking great. Above is a photo with no makeup (minus brow). I'm getting more comfortable in my skin",4

Luxurious texture & gentle",5.0,"I used to use only oils to clean my face but as I'm getting older (62), the oil started to become irritating so I tried a couple of cleaners. This is the one I will be sticking to. This cleanser is so easy on my skin that I'm amazed at how well it cleans it. The texture of this is really lux feeling. There is no foam - which bothered me a little bit at first. I actually started out using too much of the product because I thought I needed to. I have learned that it only takes less than a nickel-sized amount. That means the one bottle will last me a while. Other than how gentle this is, the other thing I love is that there is zero scent and zero irritation. I don't wear makeup but this does clean away all the sunscreen and moisturizers I wear throughout the day. I like that it is so non-drying that I don't have to rush to apply moisturizers after I use it. My skin is in love.By the way, like the other couple of LRP products I've tried, this one has a good list of ingredients and the expiry date is well-marked.",120

Great cleanser especially for dry skin",5.0,"As someone who loves skincare and has dry skin, I love this cleanser. It cleanses so well and doesn't strip your skin of its natural oils. It's moisturizing and has a great formula that benefits your skin. It also has NO fragrance, which is amazing for skincare.I recommend one pump, lather it in your hands for 10seconds, then lather it on your face for 40seconds, then rinse your face after 10seconds. Wash your face everyday, for dry skin like me I do it every night. For oily Skin try morning and night, also try to double cleanse, so repeat it twice. Good luck on your skincare journey!",7

Moisturizing",5.0,Super moisturizing! Doesnâ€™t leave my face feeling dry or tight! It doesnâ€™t really lather but one pump is enough to cover my face. Also I love thereâ€™s no overwhelming scent! Just clean and fresh.,2

Works well",5.0,"I am used to scrubbing beads in my face wash.  This is very smooth with not scrubbing agents (sorry, can't think of a better word).  This actually worked better than I thought it would.  It almost feels like soap.  To see that this was working, I would wash my face with another face cleaner that I have to see if there is any dirt that comes off after using this cleaner.  Very happy to say that there was no left over dirt after using this.  I just rub it into my face for a minute and takes it all off.  Nice to have it at such a low price, too.",13

Best face wash I have ever used",5.0,I have oily skin but bought this when I started accutane since its so gentle and just never stopped using it. It doesn't contain actual soap so it doesn't foam up like a regular cleanser but you can undoubtedly feel how clean your skin is after.  Also nice that it doesn't strip the skin. Been my go to for almost 2 years and I would never switch to anything else.,0

Super hydration!!! Highly recommend!!!",5.0,My two new fave face products in my everyday routine. This review is over 1 1/2 month since Iâ€™ve started using them.Before I start stating my thoughts on this product I must start off by stating my skin type and concerns. I have very sensitive skin and most days itâ€™s dry only when the place is extra humid then I get oily skin (which is not often bcz I donâ€™t be in the sun.) btw these products has very little scent which is very good for ppl who has highly sensitive nose or migraines that get triggered by high scents like me.The face wash is so great itâ€™s super gentle on the skin and when you wash it off it shows right away how hydrating n clean your face looks after. (My skin is so sensitive that when I used any other face wash for less than 2min it would burn n leave a red scar on my face especially around my nose n mouth area I would then have to apply aloe burn cream)The face moisture is definitely doing what it says super moisturising and light weight no greasy or too oily feel to the skin leaving your face looking glowing and hydrating. I already placed an order for my next bottle to come.,19

MUCH BETTER THAN CEARA VE",5.0,"I had been using Ceara Ve, but the fragrance was really starting to bug me and my skin didn't feel like it was getting any of the advertised benefits.  I tried this La Roche-Posay and noticed the difference right away.  I don't smell anything when I use it, it doesn't sting and my face truly feels softer and moisturized afterwards.  I actually noticed a difference between the two products.  Will repurchase this again.  Glad I stopped the Ceara Ve.",6

My Favorite Hydrating Cleanser",5.0,"I began purchasing this product a long time ago and have always returned to it despite trying out other cleansers from time to time.Some cleansers feel as though you are stripping the natural oils from the face.  This one is not like that â€“ it feels very moisturizing and gentle on the skin.  Also, some hydrating cleansers don't feel as if they are actually cleansing the skin.  This one feels both cleansing AND hydrating.Also:â€¢  it doesn't break me outâ€¢  one bottle lasts a long timeâ€¢  it's affordable compared to many other brands that unnecessarily charge an outrageous price.  I would rather pay a fair price for a simple cleanser and splurge on skin care products that offer more bang for their buck. Products that are geared for antiaging, brightening the complexion, firming products, and so forth.â€¢  the ingredients are not harshâ€¢  it is gentle on the eyes â€“ they never sting with this one!â€¢ my skin feels soft and well-nourished after cleansingâ€¢ it's oil-free, sulfate-free, and paraben freeâ€¢  it can easily be purchased here on Amazon or at the drugstoreâ€¢ it has heath-promoting skincare ingredients, such as niacinamide and ceramidesI have turned many of my friends onto this cleanser as well.  They all love it and have made it their go-to. I also do not expect to steer away from this product anytime soon.** For reference, I am 50 years old with normal healthy skin.",36
