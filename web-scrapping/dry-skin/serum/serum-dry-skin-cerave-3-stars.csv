So so product",3.0,"I’ve been using Cera Ve facial cleanser and moisturizer for years.  I have rosacea and sensitive skin.  I thought this would be worth a try.  This product goes on smoothly, sinks in immediately, is never sticky, and is a good moisturizer.  It stings a little for the first few minutes, then settles in.  I haven’t noticed any great change in the redness, but it doesn’t irritate my skin.  I probably won’t purchase it again because of the price, especially for the small bottle that you get.",0

Ridiculous Price Increases",3.0,"I have used this product for several years with great success. In fact in my experience, all Cerave products are excellent. That said, I think that this company is following the lead of many other US corporations by raising prices ""just because we can"". In Feb of 2022, I purchased this cream from Amazon for $12.60 (a few months before that for even less at Walmart). Here we are in March of 2023 and the price has risen to $18.28 (more at Walmart). Does anyone think that  ALL  of this price increase can be attributed to inflation?I gave this product 3 stars - 5 stars for the product and 1 star for marketing.",2

Probably a pretty good value for most",3.0,"I don't know why, but it makes my skin burn on contact, which is strange considering I have the same brand with glycolic acid and it doesn't do that at all and Hyaluronic acid isn't really supposed to burn - it's not like a skin stripping type acid - I mean, I've had it injected with no trouble. This also doesn't really go on well - it's kinda heavy and it doesn't have that wet feeling I was expecting - the kind of feeling you get from a skinmedica product. I was trying to replace skinmedica with something less ridiculously expensive, basically and it hasn't worked out. They should consider improving this product.",0

Nothing Special",3.0,"I purchased this product based on a rave recommendation from things.i.bought.and.liked (TIBAL)'s Instagram. I applied this product in the evening, after cleansing, and would sometimes layer an additional moisturizer on top. The product itself was just ok for my preferences. I did not notice or feel anything worthy of exemplary praise. In the mornings, I rinse my face with warm water only. The one thing I disliked about this product is I felt it would all rinse off in the morning and none of it was actually staying with my skin. Because of that reason, I will finish the product but I will NOT repurchase.",7

Okay, but not really a serum",3.0,"I got this as it was highly recommended for dry skin during Accutane. My skin is insanely dry and the moisturizers I used just weren't cutting it. I've been using this for about a week now and while it does moisturize the skin and it feels nice and plump right after applying, you can't really layer it under a moisturizer or sunscreen as it starts pilling. I live in California, I need to be able to wear sunscreen. I'm guessing this is because it doesn't have the typical serum consistency, it is very thick and not fluid.

Good for my purposes",3.0,"I don't wear makeup on my face, and I only purchased this to use as a niacinamide-free moisturizer (yes, it's labeled as a serum, but it has the consistency and sealing ingredients of a moisturizer). I wanted a product without niac for the times I use a vit C serum, just in case there's some truth to the rumor that niac and vit C don't mix. Otherwise, I use the PM lotion.Since it's my last layer, I can't tell that it pills, and I'm ok with it sitting on my skin. It does leave my oily skin quite soft.EDIT: Taking one star off.

When I order a serum, I expect it to be pretty much a clear liquid, with maybe just a little thickness to it. This product does not play well with others and does not work under make-up AT ALL. I have very dry skin and most products are sucked right up. This one sits on top of my skin and pills - badly - when I try to apply anything on top of it. It might work for a night application, but I have not tried that since hyaluronic acid is only a part of my morning routine. Super disappointing.",31

Formulation is key but still...",3.0,"The Good: This ""serum"" really feels more lotion-like and could potentially be used on its own, unlike most hyluronic acid serums that are really about hydrating the skin, but need something to seal in that hydration besides it. It feels smooth on the skin and if you want to pare down the amount of products, this could potentially work.  When I realized all the ingredients in this (more down below), I switched to using this only in the morning, and right before my moisturizer and SPF, and haven't had a problem.The Bad: However, I typically like to use a separate moisturizer instead of a product like this. Dimethicone is the fourth ingredient, so there's a good amount of it in here, and as a result, if you add any other active products to your skin after this serum, it will be harder/take longer for those to penetrate the barrier you've just applied to your skin. In addition, the fifth ingredient is Alcohol Denat, aka denatured alcohol, which can damage your own skin's barrier. It's designed to allow the other ingredients in the formula to penetrate deeper. In general, I try to avoid skincare products with denatured alcohol in them. But your mileage may vary.The Bottom Line: I'm a big fan of Cerave products (their cleansers and most of their moisturizers are holy grail status for me), but this would be at the bottom of my list. I just don't think I'd get another one, so this would be a pass for me.",24

If you want it for hydration, consider the SPF30 face cream instead",3.0,"I usually really like CeraVe products but this one is about average in all regards, deserving only 3 stars. CeraVe products are usually great at doing the one thing they are supposed to focus on and very good for sensitive skin. In terms of sensitive skin tolerance the Hyaluronic acid serum is similar to other quality products with this substance. It is at most average, however in all other regards. The scent is alright; at first it has a traditional CeraVe scent but it quickly fades away (within 2 minutes) and leaves the smell similar Hyaluronic acid serums have. It does not moisturize the skin well and after a few minutes, the product dries out and leaves a very neutral skin, in this regard I prefer CeraVe spf 30 face cream. The texture is very light, almost watery which is pretty much the same as that of all the other similar products I have tried. Overall it is what you pay for; an average priced product (for a brand-name face serum) that feels on par with the competition's products.",0

GUMMY! NOT for under makeup or day use",3.0,"I wanted to love this serum as I love most CeraVe products. Let’s just say I have varying oily-dry, hormonal acne prone skin depending on the day, season, and stress levels. I have been using their products for years at the recommendation of my dermatologist along with the “big gun” prescriptions; Retin-A, glycolic acid etc. etc. to prevent over-stripping/drying my skin. This serum goes on nice but it dries GUMMY!!!! Let’s just say it’s an apply only at night and when you don’t have to go out in public situation. Otherwise, you will have gummy balls of this randomly falling off your face....honestly, the mess due to I believe absorption issues with this serum is NOT worth it. I really hope they can reformulate this serum so it’s not horribly gummy. I’ve used many hyaluronic acid serums like this in the past and never had such a problem with the texture once dry. Please fix this CeraVe! I love all of your other skincare products.",0
