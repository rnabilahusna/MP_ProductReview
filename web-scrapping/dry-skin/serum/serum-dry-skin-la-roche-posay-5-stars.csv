Believe the hype",5.0,"Okay, I bought this on a Prime day, immediately regretting my purchase. It arrived quickly and I tried it. The smell is quite perfumery…smells like my grandma. But OMFGoodness!!!??! It leaves my skin so dewy, bright, and glowing without glitter, shimmer or grease. My skin actually looks younger and it looks that way all day, not just while it dries! It layers nicely, no pulling or balling up when I later it over products or layer heavier moisturizer, sunscreen or foundation over it. It makes powder set without looking Cakey. I’ve actually stopped wearing foundation and just use a little bronzer about 30 minutes after I apply this. It sets and I look radiant and healthy all day.Do NOT hesitate to buy this!",55

My Botox Lady Said ""Your Skin Looks GREAT!""",5.0,"I saw it on TikTok to be used as a lip plumper and decided to give it a try. Then, I put it all over my face, neck, and hands, and it's literally like a miracle potion! After using it for only 3 days, my botox lady complimented my skin and I didn't even have it on at that time. I told her what I had been using and asked her if it was ""the real deal."" She said it was and they used to sell it there. Nobody has ever complimented my complexion before and this lady was seeing my face up close and personal. I'm so excited to have found a skin product that really works!",5

Use on my glam days",5.0,"I typically use the Ordinary hyaluronic serum and niacinamide together as a simple, affordable, fragrance free super combo. But days where I want to feel luxurious this is it!! The floral scent is a little strong, but it is so moisturizing and calming to my skin I do not need to follow up with any moisturizer!

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",5.0,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one.

But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top.",10

great product-dermatologist recommended",5.0,I ordered this item online after comparing pricing at one of the local drugstores. No one could match the Amazon price.

I would definitely recommend it!,5

Deeply hydrated skin",5.0,"Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum has become an essential part of my skincare routine. This serum has truly impressed me with its remarkable benefits.  Firstly, the packaging is sleek and practical, ensuring the product remains fresh and easy to dispense.

One of the standout features of this serum is its formulation. It contains pure hyaluronic acid, which is renowned for its ability to deeply hydrate the skin.

Great for sensitive and very dry skin!",5.0,"I never give reviews but I absolutely needed to for this product!!! I have been struggling for a while with a dry face. Whether it's been this pregnancy, the time of year it is, or a mix of both. My face had gotten so bad I couldn't put make-up on without it looking like I had dry flakes all over, just stuck on my face. I was peeling ever few days. All I had to do was run my fingers across my face and there was dry skin. I've tried other products, even a face washer with a brush. Nothing was working.  I ordered this product off a suggestion from other moms in a Facebook group. It was the best decision I've ever made for my face. I've been using this product along with the double repair face moisturizer for less than a week and have seen a huge difference already. The first couple of days my face finished peeling, lightly I may add, all the old dead skin. Now its smooth and shiny and just looks more alive than dull and dry. I still have some dry spots but nothing like before. I was actually able to put make-up on for the first time in weeks. Overall this product just makes me and my skin feel so much better and a little extra perk is it smells great too!",33

Amazing - Extremely hydrating and soothing",5.0,"I think I have bought this 5 or 6 times now because it has been amazing. It soothes wounds such as pimples and it hydrated my skin like no other (make sure to apply on damp skin). It also soothes irritation, inflammation, rashes, and other skin problems. Even though it is pricy, it is worth it and is probably one of my key ingredients in my skincare. This does have a really nice fragrance to it but even with sensitive skin (which I have) it does not cause any irritation but if you do not like fragranced products, then you should keep an eye out for this then.",28

THE BEST SERUM EVER",5.0,"I haven't had the best experience wit hylaronic acid in my opinion. There will be ones that give me a reaction to my skin (rarely ever happens idk what it happened that one time), the formula will be too sticky or just the hylaronic acid routine never works because I hate the serum I get. Oh brother, let me tell you. I LOVE THIS SERUM. When I bought this serum, I didn't know what to think. I haven't had positive experiences with hylaronic acid in the past so I didn't know what to expect. Once I put this on my face I WAS INSTANTLY IN LOVE. The consistency is perfect, it's not super sticky but it's still hylaronic acid. It's hydrating, and gives a beautiful modest glow to your skin. I have repurchased this many times in the big bottle and I use this serum 2x a day (morning & night), everyday. I will forever love this serum and never change brands. Reccomending this to anyone and everyone. GO GET THIS NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT",30

Love it!  I'm in my second bottle.",5.0,"I have used this for about a year now and I got my sister and friends hooked on it too.  I have sensitive combination skin and use this 3 or 4 times a week with my night skin care routine.  After using a gentle cleanser to wash my face, I apply this on my face While it's still slightly damp.  I follow up with an vit. C serum and then an occlusive face cream with good stuff like ceramides.  Now, in the winter, finish with a light face oil to lock all of the moisture in.It has diminished my dark spots and helped with melasma that I got from pregnancy a few years ago.  I'm on my second bottle and still think it's a great buy.",21

Yes Yes Yes",5.0,I've added this into my skin cycling routine after using the Hyaluronic acid serum from CeraVe. I really like that this product is more of a liquid than a lotion. You need such little product because it spreads so easily on your face this whole bottle will last months!,7

Impacted my skin almost immediately",5.0,"Love, love, LOVE this serum. I am in my mid-40’s and tend to have normal to dry skin but it’s been super dry this winter. This product is so silky smooth but it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a residue. It has a very light but pleasant scent and I could tell a difference in the softness of my skin after just 3 days of use morning and night. I am hoping that consistent use of this along with retinol will impact the wrinkles that have started showing up around my eyes and on my forehead as well.",13

This is it!",5.0,Hyaluronic acid serum is essential for your skin care routine in my book. I always thought I had normal skin and didn't need hydration or moisturizing. I decided to give this a try and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture and smoothness. It immediately smooths out my skin and leaves a soft glowy texture. I use twice daily and it works well under my make up. Highly recommend !,10
