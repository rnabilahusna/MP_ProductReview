The Secret to My Clear Skin Routine",5.0,"After incorporating CeraVe into my daily skincare routine, I've experienced a remarkable transformation in my skin. I start with the La Roche Posay Purifying Foaming Face Wash, followed by the Neutrogena Stubborn Texture Serum with Niacinamide. Then comes the star of the show, the CeraVe serum, which has become a staple in my regimen. Its hydrating and nourishing properties have contributed to the newfound clarity of my skin. To seal the deal, I finish with the La Roche Posay Face Moisturizer Sunscreen Toleriane, featuring Ceramide and Niacinamide. These four products together have not only enhanced the texture of my skin but also garnered compliments on my radiant complexion. CeraVe has undoubtedly earned its place in my skincare arsenal, making it a must-have for anyone seeking a clear and glowing complexion.",11

Best product ever purchased for my sking!",5.0,"I read that Hyalaronic acid was an immediate positive  for dry skin so I decided to try this item. That advice turned out, was an under statement! I'm in my sixties, live in an arid climate and have used dozens if not hundreds of products (many that were $100 a bottle) to help my older dry skin. None of those ever made much of a difference. Literally the first 24 hours after applying this product to my face, followed by moisturizer per instructions, my skin felt AMAZING! I selected the Cerave product since I already trust in their products. I use Cerave daily moisturizer for daytime and Cerave Skin renewing Night cream at night. They were ok but now the difference is like Night and Day (pun intended :) This is only day 3 and this has truly changed my skin for the better immediately!",17

My skin is basically addicted to this!",5.0,"I found this product a few years ago when I learned a bit about hyaluronic acid and tried it. The affect was great, my skin got smooth and it just felt like the quality of my skin got better. I stopped using it a few months ago and omg. Break outs, huge pores, haggard appearance. I promise it all came to fruition.I thought, ok it’ll clear up on its own if I just keep my face clean. It honestly didn’t improve. I went ahead and bought this product again. And it’s honestly only been a week since I brought back into my routine and already my skin quality has shown drastic improvement. The breakouts have settled, my pores have minimized, and I look better.I’ve tried other versions of hyaluronic acid and they down have the same effect. I do try to stay with cerave brand with all my products. I have sensitive skin so finding a brand that doesn’t make me break out in a rash. I’ve learned my lesson though and this product will always be in my routine from now on.",26

Punches way above its weight - try before you spend too much money on designer stuff",5.0,"Just bought this tiny little bottle of HA and I'm actually really happy with it. I've used a few HA serums before and they always left my face feeling sticky and unpleasant. This is more like a lotion that feels quite luxurious to the face and disappears INSTANTLY into the skin (maybe my skin is just thirsty). I like Cerave products because there are other actives in them besides the main one, so I feel like I get a lot more for my money than I would if I were to buy the comparable product from like Obagi. As a daily moisturizer this really makes your skin feel good, especially if you deal with sensitive skin issues after things like shaving or if you have dry skin. I use this to treat slightly dry skin on my face that also has textural issues and fine lines (33 yo so it be like that I guess) in combo with other products that are easily 10x as expensive for the same volume, but I regret those Alle purchases because this gave me a 60% improvement on my skin issues overnight fml.Good stuff, try this before you spend another $400 on med-spa level stuff.",47

Great for super dry skin",5.0,I have super dry skin and tyryed everything in the market. Not even the expansive cream/ serum  from macys or Sephora helped. They were over priced and did barely anything. The hyaluronic acid is a life changer. U have to make sure ur skin is a little moist before applying the serum so u can the most benefit out of it. I spritz my face with some rose water first let it dry a few seconds but not completely dry than apply the serum. Makes ur skin super soft and supple.,12

Love it",5.0,This is so much better than the oily liquids on the market.  I like that it is a cream and it glides on.  It has really helped the evenness of my skin and my skin is much smoother.  It works better than most drug store brands.  It's my favorite.,3

Not to heavy.",5.0,"As an older woman 70+ my face regimen has changed. I don’t like to use a heavy daytime moisturizer but need one for nighttime. For daytime This lets me get the skin turn over properties of an exfoliate with the hyaluronic acid plus a light moisturizing effect which soaks in nicely. The main thing I have started using this with is my concealer make-up. I hate the look of a concealer cream on my old wrinkles skin so I put 2 pumps of this in my palm and a light dollop of my makeup, mix it well and use as a tinted moisturizer. It is smooth and dries well.",19

Good Absorbency",5.0,"Cerave is my favorite skin care mine. Great for all skin types and it absorbs and works!!  My acne has even improved since I made the switch to Cerave products.This serum is incredibly lightweight and doesn’t leave a tacky feeling on your skin, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Works great as a first layer and then let it sit 2-3 minutes and apply your Cerave lotion.Has no smell which is also nice.",9

Moisturizing, but not greasy!",5.0,"I started accutane months ago for my acne, so my skin became dry and irritated. I tried my regular, unscented face lotions, but the more I used, the more my face just felt greasy. It also seemed like lotion was just a temporary fix. It was frustrating putting on makeup because mu makeup wouldn't blend into the dry patches of skin and looked horrible. Since using this stuff, I have not had that problem at all. I stay flake-free all day. I noticed a difference immediately-as in the first day. I'm loving my skin for the first time in a long time.",9

Great for sensitive skin",5.0,"I have scar areas on my face where i had peeling after an eczema flare up.  It was looking like permanent frown lines because my skin was always dry no matter how i moisturized it. The skin products I have been using for more than 10 years didn't seem to work as well for me anymore.  I started to try this together with cerave moisturizer (with 30spf sunscreen) and the foaming face wash.  After about 5 days of use, my eczema is starting to go away. My skin is still peeling a little but the lines and redness are minimized.  My skin seems more moisturized despite having a colder/dryer weather now.  So i think it does what it's supposed to do.  We'll see in a month if it works just as good.",19
