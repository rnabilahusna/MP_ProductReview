NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN",1.0,"This product is NOT for those of us with sensitive skin. When I initially tried it, my skin felt great. About 12 hours later, I started to notice a chapped feeling around my lips (which is odd because I'm typically very light on applying anything in that area). As the hours have gone on, I've noticed little blisters around ym lips and on my neck. I have always had sensitive skin and combination skin, so I always have a hard time finding products to help find the perfect balance. I have a history if eczema and can't use certain body washes.I'm not sure how long to expect this reaction for, but if it goes on for a few more days I'll be searching out help from my doctor, as benadryl did not help.I'm sure this products is great for some people, but if you have sensitive skin, STEER CLEAR.",4

HORRIBLE SKIN REACTION",1.0,I purchased this to help with my dry winter skin as well as use it for anti aging propertiesI was recommended this product by my sis who swears by it.Normally I use Lancome but gave this a try after seeing how nice her skin lookedThe product felt sticky but moisturizing but I then noticed a tingling itchy sensation a few hours after usemy skin became red and inflamed. First the itchy red inflamed skin happened my face was so itch it felt unbearable nothing would make it stop. I cleansed my face and let it air dry but over the next few days the itchiness and redness persisted. My skin began to get extremely dry it actually felt rough and scaly. nothing I used would absorb or moisturize it. the redness was still visible ib addition to scaly skin. This lasted for a week. Once I was able to calm the skin and get rid of the redness my skin continued to feel rough  depleted of moisture. No matter what I did nothing worked I felt so embarrassed and confused at the reaction my skin had. Reading all the reviews made me feel like this was the product for me. I wish I had know more about the ingredients before buying. It's almost a month later and my skin is still not back to normal. It's extremely dry cracked and scaly. I am not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is typical for some.THIS PRODUCT ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.  The pictures are of the redness from the first use. I will add more of the dry flaky skin,18

Strong fragrance",1.0,"I’ve previously used Skin Ceuticals B5 serum which I love. It instantly soothes your skin and absorbs quickly. I’ve been using it with tretinoin and it works very well together. However, it costs $83 for 1 fl oz.I use a La Roche-Posay cleanser that I really like so when I saw they also sold a B5 gel I though I would give it a try. Because I’m using a prescription retinol I have to be very careful with what I apply to my skin. This serum is heavily fragranced—the smell reminds me of perfume my grandmother wore. I applied it before bed but the smell was so strong I had to wash it off. It also doesn’t absorb well and left my skin feeling sticky almost like dried soap. The area around my nose and jaw started to itch. My skin definitely did not feel moisturized.Because I’m familiar with hyaluronic serums I question if this is a legit product. The consistency is not similar to anything I’ve experienced before nor has any B5 serum smelt so potent. If you’re looking for something around this price point try Glossier’s hyaluronic serum. If you can spend a little bit more and want to see results try Skin Ceuticals B5 serum. But don’t buy the La Roche-Posay serum.",10

Gave a terrible reaction!",1.0,"I wish I would have taken photos last night when the reaction was added to worst. This is after washing the serum off twice and using a facial cleansing cloth. I thought that breaking out amongst my forehead, which is not common for me, was happening just because I have been sick and using the same pillowcase. Once I realized how bad it truly was, it became clear that the serum is what caused my skin to react this way. If you look at the photos, you will see that I even have bumps on my eyelid, which is highly unusual. I will be returning immediately. Do not recommend at all, especially those with sensitive skin. I do not have the most sensitive skin, so this really is a big deal.",11

gave me a huge rash; would not recommend for people with eczema",1.0,"I was expecting something to help mydry eczema-prone skin, but instead I broke out into a huge rash immediately after using it.  I'm sure this is fine for people without eczema, or maybe even people with mild eczema, but it definitely isn't for moderate to severe skin issues. I found fragrance and propylene glycol on the label, neither of which are recommended for sensitive skin.Overall: I probably should have found the ingredient list before ordering. I love La Roche Posay for other products so I just clicked buy without thinking. This review is for people who have bad skin like me, so feel free to ignore this if you don't have eczema waiting to strike at any moment.",4

Not right for me",1.0,"I use other La Roche Posey items and love them wanted to try an anti-aging serum and tried this one for a few weeks. It is very fragrant as if there is a perfume added and unfortunately with my sensitive skin it made me breakout. The breakout is painful and in spots I normally do not get acne. It’s almost as if it clogged my pores. Unfortunately I would not recommend this product specifically but would recommend many other products from this brand. I’m upset for paying the price for it without being able to use all of it. I used a few weeks worth, the rest will be going in the garbage.",3

So, I don't know whether this is a used product & someone filled it with something before returning it for a refund.  All I know is I just left the dermatologist office because I have strange little bumps on my cheeks.  I brought all my skincare products with me and she picked this out and told me NOT to use it.  I'm on a low-dose retin-A and she thinks either the product itself was tampered with OR it is not working well with the Retin A & causing an inflammation.",3

Nope",1.0,"The first thing I noticed when I put a little on my fingers is that it had a very strong horrible smell, like moth balls and old lady perfume (no offense to old ladies).  I rubbed some into my face and neck, and noticed a slight stinging sensation.  My face turned bright red.  I immediately washed my face, wiped off my neck, and tossed the bottle into the trash.  A residual amount was left on my neck, and the smell bothered me all evening.  The product claims to be suitable for sensitive skin, but in my case it was not.  YMMV, but I would give it a pass on smell alone.",3

This product is NOT non-comedogenic!  Beware.",1.0,"Only bought it so I could use up a $10 Amazon credit...had to use it on a product sold by Amazon.  Since my regular favorite, Cosmedica, ran out, I needed to replace it so I thought I’d use my credit (the Cosmedica was ineligible).  It claimed to be non-comedogenic, which is one of my main requirements.  Well, this serum made my skin it and break out in an awful way (I’m 55!).  So, into the trash it goes...$21 down the drain.  It is NOT non-comedogenic!  I’ll go back to Cosmedica Hyaluronic serum—it works and doesn’t make my skin break out.",7
