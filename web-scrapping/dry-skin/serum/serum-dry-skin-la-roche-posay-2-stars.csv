Not impressed",2.0,"The smell is too strong. It leaves my face greasy. I read the reviews before purchasing, so I was really hoping I would love this stuff. It’s only been a few days since I got it. I will continue to use it in smaller amounts and not as often, I wanted to use 1x daily for best results. Will update after several more weeks of use.",0

Not good for sensitive rosacea skin.",2.0,"First, I’d like to start by saying I love other La-Roche Posay products  in fact, I use their gentle hydrating cleanser and double repair moisturizer every single day.. However, my skin could not tolerate this serum. My skin burned, itched and even became so irritated that my neck broke out into a rash. I loved the texture of this product and honestly I wanted to love it but after minutes of applying it,  my skin was so itchy and irritated. I have rosacea and have been looking for a hyaluronic acid that is not irritating. Unfortunately I will have to keep experimenting with other brands for a hyaluronic acid. I am very disappointed as this is one of my favorite brands. If you are sensitive to fragrance, or have the super sensitive type 2 rosacea, I do not recommend. I seen others who have rosacea mentioned this worked for them, however it does not work for everyone. I will be retuning.",4

Not for sensitive skin",2.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I do not recommend this for sensitive skin, after a week of use I got a rash with mini pimples (see video). The pimples went away ~3-4 days after I discontinue the serum.  I wanted to love this because the HA I usually use is very expensive. I think the culprit might be the fragrance use for the serum. So beware. I don’t even know what to do with the reminders.",13

Wouldn't buy again but didn't give me a rash",2.0,"Like everyone else has mentioned, these did come as if they've been open before, I would have returned them but I was dermarolling that night and don't own any other hyaluronic acid at home so I gave it a shot. It was good enough, didn't give me a rash or anything like others have mentioned, but it isn't something I'll ever buy again on here due to the shadyness of appearing like it was opened prior. Also they sent me 3 instead of 1? Wonder if this was to convince me I got a ""good deal"" and distract me from the fact they clearly appeared to have been opened. Probably will toss out and buy something in store. Would not recommend.",0

TOO FRAGRANT",2.0,"The texture and look of the product was fine, but the fragrance was overwhelming. I have other La Roche Posay products I love.

Far Too Fragrant",2.0,"I really do like this brand. The cream cleanser is brilliant; Super good feel & leaves the skin very smooth & soft. This product however I find to be strange in that it is SO fragrant it resembles dollar store perfume. That is so interesting because nothing about a hyaluronic acid would suggest it needs fragrance for efficacy or even pleasantry so it leaves me scratching my head as to why this product needed perfume. My other reservation is: it sits on top of the skin in a tacky film. It doesn’t really absorb into the skin at all. Potentially that tacky film is what leaves you looking dewy but at the expense of in my experience long lasting hydration & also pleasantness. Lastly, all this brands products sold by the site arrive in damaged packaging and this one arrived with a ripped box and the dropper had thumb prints (which I sanitized before use). I don’t know, for $30 this is decent in appeal but I think the fragrance is super off putting & sticky feel is not cool. That’s my 2 cents.",8

I did not like it",2.0,I did not like it. It smelled weird and felt weird on my face. I should have bought it at a place I can return. I love Cerave’s way better. This one is sticky.

Bad News if You Have Dermatitis and Rosacea, even if La Roche Posay usually does wonders.",2.0,"I really love La Roche Posay. A combination of L'Oreal brand Micellar water (no fragrance), Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer, La Roche Posay Anti-Redness Serum, the La Roche Posay Hydrating Cleanser, and the Anthelios Mineral 50 spf sunscreen, has basically made my rosacea disappear.But the fragrance in this is deadly. It caused a bad dermatitis reaction. It's one of the few LRP products I would tell someone with rosacea to avoid.",6

Acne factory",2.0,"The hyaluronic acid is as effective as claimed.  My wife's skin was tighter and more toned after application.  The reason for the two stars is that she broke out after three days of use.  This product was used on a person with dry skin with no history of acne.  La Roche-Posay, redesign the serum with non-comodogenic ingredients.",5
