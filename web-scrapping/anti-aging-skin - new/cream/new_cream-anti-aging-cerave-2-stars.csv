Not what I was expecting",2,"This product should not be called 'skin renewing'. It's just spf 30 sun protection. I was expecting a product with the words skin renewing in the title to feel more moisturizing. Instead, it leaves a white residue on your face. So, if you want some spf then this is it, but I recommend you don't touch your face because it'll smear and look horrible.",0

1980’s Sunscreen",2,I’ve used a lot of different face moisturizers over the years and I always prefer ones with SPF.  Unfortunately this one misses the mark.  It is so thick you need tons of pumps to have enough to cover your face and it goes on thick like 1980’s sunscreen. I don’t recommend this unless you’re going to the beach otherwise it’s way too heavy.,0

Not for me",2,"La verdad es que pensé que hidrataría más, pero la crema es reseca y bastante espesa. En lo personal no me ayuda para nada, pues mi piel es reseca y necesito humectarla, así que al combinar esta crema con mi serum, la crema se despega de mi piel en un montón de bolitas blancas que tengo que “sacudir” de mi piel, y pues al final prefiero no usarla, porque no importa con qué otro producto lo combine, pasa lo mismo. Y no me sirve usarlo solo.",0

So very disappointed!",2,"I’ve been looking for a good moisturizer with both retinol and sunscreen, so when I spotted this I had high hopes.

Mine arrived broken!",2,I have purchased this Cerave Moisturizer before and love the product. This time it arrived and the pump was broken so I had to return it. I feel like to product works well for my dry mature skin but Cerave could change the packaging as it looks like many others have the same problem with this pump dispenser design.,0

Leaves your face white, powdery finish",2,I like Cerave products and decided to try this one. The pump is not too efficient. Product is thick and creamy. I like that it has retinol and spf. It leaves your face white which I don't like. The finish is dry/powdery when it dries. Not a fan.,0

Same Issue with Dry Consistency - Kind of like clay",2,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering this.  After trying this for a few days my first thought was that I maybe I got a stale or out-of-date batch that had been sitting on the shelf for too long?  I couldn't find any dates on the packaging, but the consistency is unusual for a moisturizing product, very dry, almost like a light clay.  And it does flake and pill when you apply it, even after letting my CeraVe vitamin C base layer dry for over an hour first.  Everything else in my CeraVe product line is fine, but this one either has a formula issue or an inventory control problem.",0

Leaves white film on face",2,"I bought this to use a retinol after work. The first time I applied it,  I had to spend a while rubbing it in to make the white glaze go away. However, it I rubbed to much, it would start to come off in small pills. I was going somewhere, so I had to rub it all off due to the uneven appearance on my face. I haven't used again.",0

Love Cerave but this product is not it",2,"Have been using Cerave moisturizers and sunscreens for years and thought this product would be my holy grail since I am in my 30s and need a little anti-aging TLC. But the texture of the product is SO incredibly thick and very hard to rub in. It is decidedly not lightweight and not light enough for daytime use.

Terrible product",2,"Very unhappy with product. I normally love everything I have used from CeraVe however, this product is substandard. It goes on very thick and is hard to get rubbed into skin. Once you get it rubbed in, it makes your skin look pasty and also makes your skin appear to have flake marks anywhere you touch. I wish I had kept the packaging so that I could return. Will have to start over looking for daytime moisturizer with sunscreen. This product is awful and I wasted my money!",0

The cream is nice ... but the delivery system is flawed. I still will not purchase again until the product is in a different package.There are so many reviews regarding the packaging here ... why didn't I listen!! it's not worth the stress of buying this. They put the night cream in a pot - why not the day cream?? I've been digging the product out of the bottle with a q-tip for the last week.  There's at least a week more of product in there.

I Love The Cream, Hate the Pump Bottle",2,"I use 5 Cera Ve skin products & swear by them. They're the Best.

Dumb bottle",2,"With the way the bottle is designed, much of the lotion goes to waste because it can't get it all out and it's very difficult to force it out once the bottle is partially used up. Hard to say how much goes to waste, but seems like it's at least 1/4 of the bottle. Plus, one that I just opened up won't even pump out from the start, but unfortunately it's too late for me to return it",0

It would sort of pill up and leave a layer on my skin. Like when I’d rub my face it would create these little blobs of the lotion. It never seemed to absorb fully.I tested and didn’t have that issues when I was using a different product. Maybe it’s my skin type but I won’t be purchasing again.,0
