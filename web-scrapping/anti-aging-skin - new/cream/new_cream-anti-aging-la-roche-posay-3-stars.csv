Good product, poor delivery",3.0,Haven‚Äôt tried the product yet (but this was recommended by my dermatologist). This is a review of Amazon‚Äôs poor packaging and delivery methods. This is how it arrived in the thin plastic Amazon pouch. It‚Äôs really frustrating that I bought a rather pricy product and this is how it gets delivered.,4

Not fragrance free",3.0,"Have not used this long enough to know how effective it is, but description clearly says its fragrance free and it in fact has a very strong fragrance. Upon a closer look the ingredients do  have parfum/ fragrance listed.  Should have looked closer. Just as a heads up to others who may be sensitive to fragrances.",14

Not for sensitive skin",3.0,"I love la roche-posay products, but if you have skin sensitive to fragrance, this is not for you. I don't understand the fragrance in skin products. And this has a lot of fragrance. I'm sure for someone that has no problems with this, it'll work.",2

I really like what the Redermic R and how it works",3.0,"I really like what the Redermic R and how it works, and I believe my skin is a little improved; however, as I mentioned in my review of Redermic C, it has such a strong scent that I can't use it every night.  Like the Redermic C, the smell tones down after about 20 minutes, but in that time I can develop a headache.  I would love to find this product unscented.",5

Concerned about packaging, etc.",3.0,"I bought this product through Amazon b/c I have such great results with my Amazon purchases. BUT the box had strike throughs (blue pen) on the UPC bar code, and the product seemed like it may have been open. It definitely wasn't sealed, but the container itself was dented in and it just seemed off.I haven't used the product yet. Not sure what I'm going to do. Probably return it...

Took a chance and bought the full size because it wasn't horribly expensive. Should have saved the $$. It still smells great and feels great, but has caused me to break out... and I have finally reached the age where zits shouldn't be a problem :-). Will not be purchasing again.",3

Pricey retinol product, but very gentle",3.0,"This is the first retinol product I ever bought. I thought I could get my skin ready for a possible retin a treatment in a month (which I did get). It's a very creamy serum, has a light scent, not bad but I didn't appreciate that either. Packaging is great, which allows you to dispense as much or little as you need. It didn't do anything to my skin in terms of wrinkle care, but it slightly calmed my skin during a small breakout. It absorbs on the skin pretty fast and goes well with other products. It's also a gentle product, now that I'm using retin a for my face, I use this for the area under the eyes, which has some fine lines and is very dry, my skin tolerates it well even though there's no improvement yet.But I think the retinol concentration is too low to be worth the money. I ordered this product in January, the price was $39.99. A couple months later, $56.99?? What's the change??",3
