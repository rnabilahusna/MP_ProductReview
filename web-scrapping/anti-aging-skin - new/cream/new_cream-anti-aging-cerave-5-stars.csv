Great daytime active SPF with a few caveats",5,"I bought this product on the search for daily sunscreen I could wear and the Retinol was a nice bonus. So far I like it enough for it to become my go-to sunscreen but there's a few caveats to using this:Pros:- It goes on quite smooth. I do have to rub it in and let it sit for a bit in order to get rid of the overcast (you definitely have to apply a solid layer for the SPF to be effective), but I'm able to apply makeup over it without any pilling like the other users suggested.- It's done wonders for my skin. I'm having a lot less breakouts and my skin is healing faster than it did before, and this was apparent almost immediately after I started using this product.- This replaces the multiple step routine I had with a moisturizer/SPF/active.Cons:- It is VERY drying. This is not moisturizing AT ALL. I find myself using a ton of moisturizer at night to prevent skin tightness the next day despite not really having dry skin normally.- You have to be REALLY careful rubbing your eyes with this product on or in the shower as it getting anywhere near them is very irritating and a bit painful.- The pump in the bottle ""broke"" immediately. After each pump, I'm able to wiggle the top back into position to allow me to pump again so I've been able to use it but it's finicky and they need to figure out a new bottle for this product.",21

Great product at a reasonable price",5,"After having a facial and living the way my skin felt, I asked my esthetician which otc moisturizer was the best and she told me about CeraVe. I was so impressed with the results that I will definitely buy again. It’s lightweight but keeps my skin very moisturized and the added retinol is a major plus for my 55+ skin.",0

Not Greasy",5,"I live in the Caribbean so I need to wear sunscreen constantly: I’m light skinned with yellow pigments and I have hyperpigmentation which I’ve worked on using a peel. This product has helped significantly as I’ve not seen any darkening of the areas. I’ve been using it for a month. It’s not greasy and goes on smoothly. I don’t have to fight to get it absorbed into my skin. My face looks ‘cool’ and smooth. And you don’t need alot either. 1 pump is sufficient. I recommend as it’s developed by dermatologists and the price is good. At 54, I need all the help I can get to age gracefully ☺️",14

Effective Anti-Aging Protection with SPF",5,"I recently started using the CeraVe Anti-Aging Face Cream with SPF, and I am extremely pleased with its performance. This face cream not only offers effective anti-aging benefits but also provides essential sun protection, making it a must-have product in my skincare routine.One of the standout features of this face cream is its inclusion of SPF. With a broad-spectrum SPF of 30, it shields my skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, helping to prevent sun damage and premature aging. The added sun protection is a crucial factor in maintaining healthy and youthful-looking skin.The formulation of the CeraVe Anti-Aging Face Cream is impressive. It contains a blend of ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, which work together to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and overall skin texture. The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling nourished and hydrated without any greasy residue.What sets this face cream apart is its ability to provide anti-aging benefits without causing irritation or sensitivity. The ceramides help restore the skin's natural barrier, while the hyaluronic acid ensures optimal hydration. The inclusion of retinol, a proven ingredient in reducing the signs of aging, further enhances the effectiveness of this cream.I also appreciate that this face cream is non-comedogenic and fragrance-free, making it suitable for sensitive skin. It doesn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts, allowing me to use it confidently without worrying about any adverse reactions.The packaging of the product is also worth mentioning. The tube design with a small opening allows for precise dispensing and ensures product freshness. It is also travel-friendly, making it convenient to take along on trips or for daily use on the go.",26

Good for men looking for simplicity",5,I'm an aging man in his 40's and people have told me my whole life to take care of my skin and wear spf every day.  I didn't listen because I had better stuff to do.  But now the age is starting to show and I wish I would have taken better care of my skin.I just rub one little pump of this stuff on my face in the morning and before I go to bed.  I also got the CeraVe eye repair cream.  I put that under my eyes at the same time.  And I've gotta say... My face looks and feels better.  Dudes...do it.  It's easy.I researched what to get and this one seems to be the consensus best value.  The only one better than this was like $70-80.  This one is $15.  It's worth it.  There's many months worth in this container.  It's probably like $2 a month.  Do it.,18

For me ...magic.",5,Packaging was great. Had no issues at all.  I work outside .. it’s winter .. turning 43 in a week .. you get the picture.  My lines were really showing. Let me tell you ... this product is amazing.  Within a few days of using this I could see a difference in the moisture of my skin.  It’s been a few weeks now and I am so so pleased with the results.  Until I need something heavier due to aging I am totally staying with this product.  I couldn’t be happier.  All I keep thinking is why didn’t I buy this sooner?  Side note ..they under eye cream is just as amazing.  I saw a woman on YouTube .. she has a channel for women turning 40 .. you know it’s a weird time when you start seeing signs of aging .. she recommends this companies products and oh boy was she right.  I literally work outside for up to 10 hours a day and as I mentioned were in the dead if winter.  And my skin has never looked better,20

If you're having trouble with the pump:",5,"If you're having trouble with the pump - this is what I've learned: there is no straw in the pump on purpose.  It's called an airless pump.  If you've been opening it up to get at the product, then stop and close it up, tightly.  Pump the pump repeatedly for a few minutes - I did until my arm got sore - and eventually, all the air will come out and then the product will, too.  I'm so relieved since I was going to buy a second one to use the straw from it, only there would have been the same problem.  Now the product comes out in normal amounts, and I keep the top twisted on tightly.  This isn't a normal gravity/air pump, it works differently, so keep the top closed tightly.For the actual lotion - I like it.  I have fairly oily skin, but was looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF and have heard a lot of good about CeraVe.  The lotion goes on sort of thick and white, but blends in well.  I use a bit of powder over it to be more matte, and cream blush, with no problems.  I use it on my eyelids, too, and have no problems with my eyeshadow staying in place.  No breakouts, no irritation, no sunburn. It smells fine and my face feels smooth and soft. This is a winner!",10

Update",5,"Changed headline to update my following comment written a few days ago! CeraVe stands behind their product, which I’v used  as a satisfied customer for several years.  Although the container was damaged it didn’t affect the cream, I was able to use a small long handle brush to get lotion out.  After reading several bad reviews decided after reading one good review I’d give it a try anyway since I’v always before found CeraV to have excellent products. To my disappointment I have experienced what other customers discovered.  I’m sure the cream is good, it has everything in it I want, it’s the container, after several tries at pumping nothing came out, opened it, no tube attached in it. When I turned it up to shake some pieces of plasticfell off, looked around the edge to see the plastic was cracked as shown in the picture. I’m surprised Quility Control would allow a container like this to leave the factory, one bad containerwould be expected ever so often but to read of so many is unexceptab! Giving a negative review is hard for me to do but in this case it should to brought to the company ‘s attention!",50

CeraVe is a favorite",5,"When it comes to moisturizers, I haven't found any my face likes as much as CeraVe.  I use this one during the day and the similar night formulation overnight.  I've tried the store brands and they don't stack up to the real thing.  My skin does not like them at all.  Just because something has the same active ingredients does NOT mean that they have the same ""filler"" ingredients.  Never have I broken out or had a reaction to anything from CeraVe and that includes any kind of eye reaction.  Fine lines and wrinkles are diminished by the retinol, but you don't get the burn that sometimes you will with a retinol moisturizer.  The sunscreen in this also doesn't bother my nose or eyes the way I've had others bother me, which is a bonus.",14

Fantastic Product!",5,"I’m obsessed with the CeraVe line of products. Everything I’ve used does exactly what it says it does. This particular product was my first introduction to CeraVe and it was recommended to me by my Dermatologist. I bought my first bottle from his office for almost twice what I paid here on Amazon. Within weeks I started to notice a difference. I am 59, have inherited fairly resilient skin but still have fine lines on my brow, around my eyes and where I smile. The first place I noticed the lines becoming less obvious was between my eyes at my “scrowl line” They were obviously lighter & smoother after about 2 weeks. However, after using this now for almost a year and on my 2nd purchase, my fine lines & wrinkles are almost non existent. I’m often asked if I’ve had work or what my secret is. My secret is no secret it’s CeraVe products!",58

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,"This is my daily moisturizer and sunscreen for my face. It’s goes on smoothly and absorbs beautifully. Skin looks fresh and feels soft and moist. Works as well as the expensive lotion from the dermatologist but half the cost. My skin has never looked better! (Note: I also use a night product with Vitamin C.) The CeraVe pump bottle is perfect for convenience; I don’t have to mess with screw-on tops to put back on. A friend of mine who’s a pediatrician and loves natural products recommended CeraVe products to me, and I’m so glad she did! EXCELLENT line of products. I depend on this moisturizer/sunscreen so much that it arrives automatically every two months via Subscribe and Save.Note: if I’m going to be in bright sun for hours, I’ll often add a sunscreen with a higher SPF, but this CeraVe product is my daily go-to product, first thing after shower and face cleanser.",3

Great moisturizing sunscreen",5,"I've used moisturizers at all different price points and this is my favorite day cream I've tried. It doesn't leave my skin slimy or greasy like a lot of moisturizers with SPF, and doesn't burn or run into my eyes like some sunscreens do. It creates a good base for applying foundation smoothly while doing what a sunscreen is supposed to do in providing sun protection.If you apply a hydrating serum and don't let it fully absorb into your skin before applying moisturizer, it does pill some, but that's resolved by taking the time to let your serum absorb properly first. My skin is visibly improved since I started using this and I highly recommend.",3
