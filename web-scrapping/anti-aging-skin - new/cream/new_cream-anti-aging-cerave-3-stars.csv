Doesn't play nice with other products",3,"I'm not sure how effective this is for sun protection.  I tossed the container after about three uses.  The problem I experienced is that it turns into a bunch of little white blobs when applied over other pre-moisturizing treatments.  I mostly use Dermelect products (I'm old.  Mama needs her anti-wrinkley stuffs), and this face cream just doesn't play nice with them.  The result is a completely unworkable base for makeup.  The first time I used it, I smoothed it over my face.  Big mistake.  Big, smeary, sticky blobs.  In the following applications, I patted it onto my face.  Also a mistake.  Small, sticky little blobs.  If this turns into blobs of product that stick to your face, I don't know how much SPF protection it really provides.",10

Super thick and the pump doesn't work",3,"This is a very heavy cream in a pump bottle.  The pump quit working on day two.  The cream is super hard to put on as it is thick and does not slide over my skin.  It feels like it dries out within seconds.  It does not make my skin feel soft or moisturized.  However it doesn't have any scent and doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.  If you want a product that makes your skin feel soft and supple, this is not for you.",0

It is a great product but...",3,"I love CeraVe products and this is the 3rd bottle I've purchased. It works great overall. It provides good skin protection, goes on well considering it is an SPF as well, and doesn't irritate or dry out my skin.But... it does create the ""piling"" effect when I put on other products after and this new pump works like crap. I think I'm able to get a little squirter out after 20+ attempts. They definitely need a new pump for sure.",0

Good as moisturizing sunscreen and subtle retinol effect",3,Light and works well as base and for a daily sunscreen. My skin slightly improved texture/wrinkle/smile lines. I've also been using another lotion so hard to tell which one truly improved lines. Does leave slight white tint. I add regular cerave lotion over it and it all blends well.,0

i like it, could definitely be improved",3,"Pros- Doesn't break me out- Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin- Actually absorbs into my skin- Has retinol in addition to SPF, so a 2in1 combo, which is always a win for me- Has lasted awhile (I use once every morning, about 4 pumps)Cons- Can be hard to spread, be sure any previous product on your face is absolutely dry- Pills up sometimes, it's too thick. This has affected how my makeup lays on my face. I find that I sometimes have to go over with a thinner moisturizer after it has dried to get rid of it.- Takes a bit to fully absorb/dry. Nothing dramatic, maybe 2 minutes.Overall I do like this product, it's not perfect but it gets the job done as of now. Hoping there's a formulation improvement.",17

Inexpensive facial cream",3,I have used Clinique for about 30 years. Im sick of spending $70 on a jar of face cream to wear during the day. I thought because this was a name brand I would try it and was thrilled with the price. It goes on nicely and feels tight on your face but very dry. I have very sensitive skin so it may simply be my skin reacting. Im 75 years old if that helps.,0

Needs Bottle Change",3,"I like this product very much.  This brand has been recommended by my dermotologist for my sensitive skin.  I use several other products by this brand.  However, please tell me how to get the remaining 1/3 of the product out of this bottle!!  It is impossible.  Storing it upside down, hitting the top on the counter or floor, and using a cotton swab to get the product out is just too much to deal with.  Therefore, I will find another product with a bottle cap that can be removed completely to be able to use the entire product.  Too costly to only use 2/3s of the bottle.

Thick and hard to smooth into skin with an serious packaging failure",3,As others have said the product does not blend in very well but the worst thing is that the dispenser is severely flawed.  If the product were thinner the dispenser might work but getting anything out of that silly dispenser is a fight.  I store it inverted as the pump does not have a straw but even inverted you have to bang the silly thing on the counter multiple times to get anything to the pump opening.  Packaging failure.,0

Dries out my skin",3,I love CeraV and have used a few of their products. This one in particular I'm not too fond of because it dries out my skin and lips. I can't be sure but I think it may be the retinol addition to the formula. Its a very thin cream and goes on clear - sometimes i have issues with my face turning white with sunscreen. I do have to add an intense moisturizer first if I do use this lotion but I think i'm just going to go back to the original SPF formula without the retinol. I'm a one-stop-shop kind of gal and don't want to have to put on multiple creams if I can avoid it. I would recommend for anyone who doesn't have sensitive skin - the dryness is the only issue I have otherwise its a good cream. Its just not for me.,5

Thick and crusty",3,I have medium to fair skin.  Perhaps this would work better if it was tinted for brown hues.  I personally did not like the white crusty film it leaves behind when you rub it in too much.Not made for lathering.  Not silky.  Not to be used as a lotion.,0

no dispensing straw",3,The reason the pump doesnt work is because the straw for the inside to suck it up is not there. This cream is very thick and I am not sure how well a straw would work anyway but I will be storing it upside down and hope i can get most of it out. It is only day one for me so I cant yet speak to how good it actually works.,0

Love cerave this just isn’t it",3,"I was bummed out about this purchase - had bought it in lieu of their regular face moisturizer with spf that I use daily because I wanted the retinol benefits; when it arrived the silver part of the lid fell off and detached the pump from the tube in the bottle so now I have to shake the bottle in order for anything to come out. The product itself leaves a white residue that doesn’t blend with my face or if I put on a makeup it flakes right off. I will say, after wearing it in the sun i noticed it had protected me from burning, so that’s a plus. But I’ll definitely be sticking to their other line of moisturizers.",2

Sticky, sticky, sticky",3,"I use several other Cerave products and this is the first one I am disappointed with. This leaves your skin really tacky and pills up when you put on primer/foundation.  I will use at night even though it's a day cream until it's gone and will not buy again.  I love the other lotions, they don't end up tacky.",0

I really wanted to like this product!!!",3,"I am a huge CeraVe fan.  I have been using their products for quite awhile.  Last fall I purchased two other CeraVe face creams, one with hydrolic acid and Vitamin C serum.  I should have stuck with those.  I needed a good day cream with Retinol.  If you look at the product (see pictures) you can see it is super thick.  Hard to spread evenly over your face.  Next, after it drys it looks like your skin is flaking or peeling.  I have to wipe it all off in order to put on my makeup.  What is the point in using this when I want a moisterizer to use under my makeup.  I think the only time I will really use this now is at nightime.  Would not recommend for a day cream.",11

Pump Operation is Terrible; Verdict Out on Quality of Ingredient",3,"I haven't used the CeraVe cream long enough to see if it works on my face, so this review is just on its operation. As someone else wrote about this product's problem, the dispensing pump is Terrible and rates a ZERO. Even after vigorously shaking the tube, I could not get the cream to come down closer to the opening, so I opened the pump lid to see why--the pump stem is super short, at about 1/4"" long and the cream starts way below that, but wouldn't work anyway because the cream is so thick it clings to the walls of the tube. So I'm digging out the cream with the handle of my tongue-scrapper, which means air is getting in every time I use it. Next time I'll try the moisturizing lotion instead.",0

Too Heavy for My Oily Skin, even in Winter",3,"I've switched to CeraVe products for about six months now, trying to heal my acne-abused skin. I like their other Skin Renewing products just fine, their night cream being my favorite. It's heavy, but in the winter my skin needs that.However, for a day cream this is a bit too heavy for me. I have generally oily, sensitive skin and CeraVe's gentle products have made a difference for me, but this one is just too heavy for my oily skin. It blends in well, but I'm quickly greasy feeling again in a few hours. This might work better for someone with drier skin, or as a winter day cream.Overall: It's not bad, I'll finish the bottle, but I probably won't buy it again.",2
