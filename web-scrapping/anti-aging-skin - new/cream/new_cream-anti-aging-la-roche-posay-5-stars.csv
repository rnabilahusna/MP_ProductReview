Is the Best retinoid I ever used especially with Sunday Riley Luna sleepin oil! You wake up looking 5 yrs younger, not kidding!",5.0,"I am on my second tube of this and yes I DO pat it around my eyes. It is a cream serum. I wait for it to sink into my skin @ 5-10 minutes, then lightly apply a moisturizer on my face, an eye cream and neck cream. I am almost 63 and don't have one wrinkle around my eyes. No one ever believes my age  ! Which I am thankful for. I use Vitamin C in the day time. Basically the serum, moisturizer, day neck cream and eye cream. I have a Clarisonic that I use @ 3x per week. I use body lotion everytime I get out of tub. I have good genes, though. My grandmother died @ age 98 without one wrinkle. She took excellent care of her skin, which is where I learned all this from. This is the best retinol cream/serum I have ever used. I plan on getting the prescription by the time I reach 65. Until then, I will keep using this. It really does work, for me at least. Update  12/19/2017: Just found it on sale for $27! A steal! Was using PTR serum with this, last few months changed over to Sunday Riley Luna sleeping retinoid oil and this! These 2 work together like you won't believe. I wake up and my skin is literally gorgeous! A few times week, I use just the oil or just the Redermic R. The two most potent items in my beauty arsenal, which I have pared down due to using the Sunday Riley oils. I use only one moisturizer,day serum, eye serum always,the Luna and Juno oils and Redermic R.  I used to use neck cream 2-3 moisturizers for day and nite. Don't have to, use the oils, they are awesome. My neck has never looked better, no kidding. You can get quarter oz of the Luna sleeping oil @ Sephora for $20 if you want to try or ask for samples of all her oils, decide what you like best. Am now about to be 65 Dec 26th, not aged a bit and skin looks better than it did when I first wrote this review. Amazon may sell Sunday Riley, look and see but for sure get the Redermic R while on sale for such a low price! Is awesome and lasts forever!",58

Instant fan!",5.0,"I'm 46, with combination sensitive skin. I expected, knowing retinol and how it works, not to see results for more than a month. But after only wearing it overnight once, there was already a huge difference in redness reduction, softness, and wrinkle smoothing. I was blown away. I wear it at night under CeraVe Night hyaluronic acid moisturizer. My face is especially sensitive right now because I'm in a show and wearing heavy makeup with latex and silicone pieces glued on my face. Getting them off requires a lot of scrubbing and application of isopropyl alcohol - massive irritation. I cleanse with cold cream and Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cream Cleanser, and this product, worn overnight under the CeraVe moisturizer, soothes the redness and irritation from makeup and adhesive removal, shrinks outbreaks from the grease makeup, makes my wrinkles shallower, and reduces my mild rosacea. Expensive, but worth every penny. I heartily recommend it.",15

Worth every penny—LaRoche products are fantastic",5.0,"I’m thrilled with this line of products. In a short time Ive seen great results. My 53-year old skin was super dull and dry, with patches of rosacea and generally pretty neglected. I started using this along with Laroche’s substantiane moisturizer. I use a glycolic toner after cleansing with laroche’s Toleraine cleanser. In about a week, I feel like my redness is at least half of what it was, my skin is so much brighter, almost creamy, and for the first time in a very long time, calm looking. My skin feels smooth and supple and the healthiest it’s been in years. I’m hoping the improvement continues. Anyway after trying tons of stuff, this has given me the best results,,and conpared to a lot out there, is very reasonably priced. My sin also uses laroche’s effaclar line and his teen skin is looking fantastic.",10

Miracle Cure",5.0,"I've had bags progressively developing under my eyes and darkness for years now. After one week of using this product everything completely cleared up.  This is not an exaggeration, the area under my eyes looks like I'm in my 20's again (I'm in my late 40's). I'm actually mind blown.I'm also putting this on some lines in my forehead and crow's feet, and after a week it hasn't done much so far, but I think it might be starting to work. It dried out my forehead, so I'm combining it with moisturizer and sunscreen.  Hopefully the deeper lines will fade a bit.",22

But then I read the reviews. I am a guy, 45 years old. I am not into skin care. Worked construction most my life outside of the Marines. I have always had huge blackheads on my nose and surrounding cheek areas. I have super oily skin. I decided to try this.Just after two weeks, I do not have a single noticeable blackhead anywhere!

At around month 4 I decided to add in this Retinol product and it took my skin to the next level! I have been documenting my journey for 6 months-I went from horrible, bumpy, acne prone, uneven skin to skin I feel comfortable in without makeup! I have never had this clear of skin, even when I was taking acne meds!

Happier with how I look after a month",5.0,"I'm in my 30s and rock a winning combo of a few nascent wrinkles, a few stubborn zits, and very sensitive skin. A friend of mine who has used this stuff for about a year and has seen noticeable improvement recommended that I try it. I've been using it for about a month -- tiny amounts about three times a week, followed with a cheap drugstore facial moisturizer and sometimes a vitamin C night cream.  I haven't had any issues with irritation or dryness, and have noticed subtle but very positive results. My skin is smoother. I still get zits, but I think they show less and go down faster. And overall I feel like the tone and texture of my face have improved. I've had a record number of mornings in the last month where I've looked in the mirror and thought, ""yeah, I look good today."" I don't love paying fifty bucks for cosmetics, but this tiny tube looks like it'll last me several months, and for now it feels well worth it.",30

it works",5.0,"I've been using this for almost 3months, and I can see a big difference.  it did dry my skin for the first  month, so I cut back to using 3times/week til my skin adjusted, and started using a better moisturizer.  my acne ( which I've had all my life, and I'm 40) is 100x better. skin texture much smoother, and wrinkles are starting to fade. my freckles even seem to be lightening. definitely will keep using this product",4

I've used this for about a month, just a pea-sized amount, every other night and then follow with moisturizer.  I have noticed my fine lines have improved and the overall texture of my skin as well.

This stuff is fabulous!",5.0,"I purchased this product in hopes that the retinol would fade some age spots, but I was a little concerned it would make my rosacea worse. I took before pictures so I would have something to compare. 12 weeks and two tubes of the product later my age spots have noticeably faded, my skin looks healthier, and not only has it not made made my rosacea worse, it actually helped it. My skin hasn't looked this good in a long time. I now have healthy pink cheeks instead of red, inflamed cheeks. And the enlarged pores that come with rosacea are going away. I even received a compliment recently from a young man on how pretty my skin is. I haven't had a compliment on my skin since my 20s  (I'm 55 years old).  Thank you La Roche-Posay.",95

Perfect!",5.0,"I've tried a lot of different lotions and creams- and for me, this is the best. It shrinks the pores and gets rid of little lines around my eyes.  I get tons of complements on my skin, and most of the time I don't even use a moisturizer. When I do use a moisturizer, my skin doesn't soak it up like before- it seems like the moisturizers ""sit on top"" of my skin. So when I use moisturizers now, I use them at night only.  I'm almost 50 now, and this is the only thing I've used that gets rid of the little lines.  I wish it were a little less expensive, but I can make a tube of it last for over two months. Oh, and I've found that the longer I've used this stuff, the better is works.  I've been using it well over a year now- and would NOT be without it.",4

Clearer skin, less sun spots, and a good value Retinol that doesn't dry out.  It's as good as Obagi to me.",5.0,"Bang for your buck this is the best Retinal I've tried and a bonus is it doesn't seem to dry me out as much.  Smoother and clearer skin with just one application.  Any time my skin starts getting congested I use this and always helps overnight.  In a sea of skin care creams that claim so much Retinoids have so much science to back them.  They've been around for years and just plain work.  Helps with wrinkles, sun spots, and slows down the breakdown of collagen.  It's a must have and it's never to early (or late) to start using this product.  This brand along with Obagi are two of my favorite brands and this one is cheaper so it's a no brainer.  I stopped paying for the Obagi.",66

I love preventative skin care and she told me I needed to start on a retin-a and vitamin c. I was hesitant because my skin is sensitive but this stuff is great. I can use twice a week without it drying my skin out. I also like to put it on any acne that pops up because it cures it quickly!The smell of it is also amazing. Such a great purchase!,4

LOVE",5.0,"I just turned 32 and decided that I really needed to get organized and disciplined with my skincare, so I purchased this based off of a recommendation from a dermatologist's YouTube channel. This is my first time using a retinol cream and I am blown away at my skin after just a week. After the first night, I woke up to my skin feeling much more plump.

I still get an occasional white head, and initially I broke out a bit. But my skin is doing much better! They say it takes 6-8 weeks to really see results, so I'm happy with the progress my skin has made already. I'll definitely be repurchasing.",25

Better than other retinol creams",5.0,"This product does not dry the skin as other retinol creams I've used. While with other retinol creams dead, flaking skin stays on my face until I scrub it off with an exfoliant, with Redermic R flaking seems to happen gradually and at a steadier pace. I don't have any wrinkle issues except fine lines under my eyes, for which I use Redermic R Yeax, but this product has definitely helped with occasional breakouts and clogged pored. This product is also marketed as a moisturizer but I still use a different La Roche moisturizer during the day ( I have oily skin).

... behind Redermic C and Redermic R and there is good science there",5.0,"I researched the biochemistry behind Redermic C and Redermic R and there is good science there. In practice, the combination of the two products used alternately is what the skin needs to repair and protect itself and the results are obvious and lasting.
