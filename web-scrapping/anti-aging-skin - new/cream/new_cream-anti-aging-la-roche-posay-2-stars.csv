Not worth the price",2.0,"I was dissappointed with this cream. The retinol doesn't seem to be very strong at all. With most retinol products, I'll notice at least some kind of redness after daily use (or even with less use) but I haven't seen any effects on my skin after using for 20 days straight.  When I used Skinceuticals retinol cream I saw immediate results and had the typical retinol redness after the first application. I was tryng to save a buck and bought this instead. I really don't think it was worth the high price. This reminds me of the ROC retinol cream you can get anywhere for a third of the price. Definitely wouldn't buy again.",6

Ineffective",2.0,"This product did not reduce wrinkles, which was why I purchased it.The scent and feel of it are pleasant but I could have paid far less than $50 for a simple moisturizer. In fact, I already own those so, after reading the reviews, I took a chance on this. I’m disappointed.",0
