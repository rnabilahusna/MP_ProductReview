No results.",1.0,"I had high hopes for this especially since I read good things about it. But I have been using it religiously daily along with sunscreen,  and unfortunately I have not seen even the slightest effect.ðŸ˜• It was not irritating to my sensitive skin so I will say that. But everybody's skin reacts differently. I'm just explaining my experience. It may work great for many others.",0

Holy Fragrance!!!!!!!!",1.0,"I don't think I can put this on my face. First of all the packaging was annoying. You have to take the cap off, take the top off and pierce the opening, then you have to put the top on and it wouldn't go on. Took a minute to figure that all out, annoying....... then i put a teeny drop on my hand and I can not believe the amount of fragrance in this product.  I have a couple of other products from this line that are fragrance free and I was not aware that this would stink so much.  I can't stand the smell on my hand and i put the tiniest drop on my hand. If you have any fragrance sensitivity, you will probably hate this. I'm returning it. I'd gag and get a huge headache if i put this on my face. Disapointed.",3

Product could have been tampered",1.0,"This product was tampered with and I am scared for my safety to use it. Is it the original product? I have my doubts including: the box it came in was taped back together with clear packing tape and there was no informational booklet inside, the tube was hard to open. The product coming out of it seems to be the right color and consistency and so far my skin hasn't broken out BUT buyer be warned",0

BURNS!! Bad for skin, not worth the $$",1.0,"The box was open, the lid was open and there was no safety seal? I guess that is just the way it is packaged but I am just unsure.I have been using it for 4 days and my skin is red and splotchy, I have several breakouts happening now as well.  The cream started to burn!! I do not have sensitive skin either. But my face is left worse off and the burning sensation has not stopped. From the other reviews I have read it seems this may not be from the actual company. But I have also seen that this company censors their reviews, which is unfortunate.",2

Didn't Work",1.0,"I bought this product primarily because it won Allure magazine's best anti-aging product award.  I don't have wrinkles except for a tiny one by my right eyebrow, but I wanted to improve the texture of my skin.The product comes in a package that is made to look like prescription medicine and warns you that this is an INTENSIVE treatment.  I thought that was gimmicky.  ""Behold this powerful, life-changing elixir...""  Meh.Still, I had hope.  I applied it daily as directed for many months.  There was no burning or stinging or anything that suggested it was ""intensive,"" and sadly, NO change in my skin at all.  Not even a tiny bit. Even my one little wrinkle was exactly the same. I didn't give up earlier because I was determined to give it a fair shot.I realize we don't all have the same skin, so what didn't work for me might work for you.  Just be aware that you could be wasting $50.",35

Caution!",1.0,"The manufacturer and its shill Allure magazine promote this as being good for sensitive skin compared to other retinol products. I believe that to be false. I used this as directed, a pea size amount in the evening, for one week. I developed terrible redness, swelling, flaking, etc. Three weeks after discontinuing use, my skin still hasn't recovered. What a miserable way to spend a month! Be very cautious with this stuff, or pay the price.Update: A full two months after using Redermic R for just one week, patches of my skin are still red and blotchy, flaking and swollen, although there is gradual improvement. It has been a nightmare.Warning: the La Roche-Posay website censors reviews: I tried posted a review similar to one here on their site and it does not appear. Only positive, over-the-top (possibly fake?) reviews appear there.",50

No change for this 45 year old",1.0,"I've been using redermic r for 10 months now and have not noticed any difference in my skin texture, pore size or freckles. I am 45 with dry combo skin and I bought this as I noticed I am getting fine lines and to prevent age spots. I use it every other night building up to everyday. I use it in the evening, without anything else. The only times I've noticed a difference is when I layered coconut oil on top then I'd wake up with softer skin. But can't tell if it's the coconut oil that's doing that. I am going to try wearing this twice a day to see any difference. Perhaps am not putting on enough as I am still on my first tube in ten months. I only use it for my face, not neck or lower. I had better results with pigmentclar and will be going back to that.",0

Yikes!  Elephant Skin",1.0,I used this under my eyes and within a week I had droopy elephant skin under my eyes that didn't exist before then.  My skin was also red and irritated all over my face.  The smell of the product is also unpleasant so I didn't want to use it during the day.  Of course my review on La Roche-Posay's website doesn't show up.  Only the 5 star reviews are printed.  Why bother reviewing a product on their website if they're going to filter them and only put the glowing reviews out there for buyers?  This product is NOT worth the money charged.  I didn't see a improvement.  My face was actually worse.,17
