Pills a lot",3.0,I have only been using this product for about a week so I won’t be able to see the results for a month. However I have noticed that this stuff pills like crazy and this says to use twice a day but I’ll only use once a day. I made sure to pay into the skin to make sure it’s absorbed and I give plenty of time between products and still pills like crazy. I’ll go for another product next time.,8

Seems to not absorb well",3.0,"Been using this for 2 or 3 weeks, every morning, on my face. Have I noticed any difference? I'm not really sure... BUT, I might be premature in my judgement because I believe the science of retinol and hyaluronic acid showing results, is only after months, not weeks. I will keep using it every day. I only use a ""pea size"" amount, rubbing it onto target areas of my face, with two fingers. I will let you know, the consistency of this cream seems a bit resistant of absorbtion into the skin. It kind of smears with your fingers as you rub it, instead of soaking in... If that makes sense. So I do have to be aware of not rubbing it with pressure, but more like dab it into the areas where I want it and then wait several minutes until I don't feel it anymore, before putting anything else on my face. I have not had any adverse reactions or negative experiences with this, at this point.Update: been using for several months now. Seems to have a problem observing. I'm not SURE if it's making any difference, if I should continue using it, if it's getting into my skin or only sitting on the surface... I wish I knew how to make it obsorb better. This is my only complaint.",12

Clumps and rubs off",3.0,"Very disappointed. This is EXPENSIVE and has such good reviews. It's OK as long as I don't want makeup over it. Even when wearing it as an overnight cream, it RUBS OFF and CLUMPS UP. So it's not really absorbing into my skin. It's just sitting on top of it.I'm a huge fan of CeraVe lotions & even their bath bar, but this is horrible. Not worth the money. Sorry.",5

Smells weird",3.0,"I have been using this product for about a month now and idk if it’s really doing anything to be honest. I have used other retinol products in the past and usually after the first or second use, my skin becomes dry in some places and that’s how I know it’s working because my skin is adjusting to the product. This one is not doing that. I started applying it once a week and now I’m applying it every other night. Don’t know if it’s doing anything. The smell is weird too. Won’t be buying this again.",8

Works but use by itself",3.0,"This product definitely did what it said it would do. Retinol is definitely one of those things your skincare routine NEEDS if you are utilizing anti-aging products. For me, I think I prefer a retinol serum as opposed to this. The reason is that when combined with my other skin care products (oil, moisturizer, sunscreen) this products started to literally peel off my face in chunks. So I would not use with other products, just on a lazy day and you aren't going out anywhere and you still want to give your skin some attention.",12

Not for me :/",3.0,I was so excited to use this product because I’m dealing with a lot of acne. And if you don’t know retinol was first made to get rid of teen acne until they found out it’s amazing for anti-aging to! Anyways I was really hoping this would work. Also I  was expecting skin purging. Skin purging is when you use a active/treatment on your skin. And basically your skin has to get worse before it gets better. Skin purging last 4-6 weeks but I watched vids on people having their skin purge for longer. So I waited and waited and yes I experienced skin purging. And it was the second month but I decided to wait a little more. Until it was already the 5th month. It didn’t work for me but it’s a great product and might work for other people. Plus my skin is very picky with what I put on it. Also sorry if there’s any grammar errors... ;-;,4

It’s ok",3.0,This is my first time using skin care products with retinol in it. This product didn’t really show much effect on me. I’m not sure if it’s not for me or I need more time to see effects. One pro for me is using the product I didn’t have any discomfort or rash. I was a bit worried at first since lots of people said their skin doesn’t react nicely with retinol.

May interfere with other products",3.0,"I'm only on my 2nd week using this product so I can't attest to its claims of reducing wrinkles and fine lines.The formula is creamy and a pump is definitely enough. It sinks into the sink at 1st leaving a tacky feel but once its fully absorbed, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and not sticky like others I've tried. There is no fragrance and the product itself doesn't have an offensive scent either.What I have noticed is that it does react with some of the moistures in my long standing routine, causing the products I put on my face to clump up and peel off of my skin. I still don't know what specific ingredient/s causes the peeling but if I am able to narrow it down I will post it.",0

Doesn't work as intended, exfoliates by peeling",3.0,"I usually love CeraVe’s products, but this one was just OK. After using it as a spot treatment for a month on some acne scarring (only tiny amounts), I’m not really seeing much benefit. This retinol serum for facial lines does seem to exfoliate in that it makes my skin peel, but I wouldn’t say this is a good thing. The thin skin over some healing acne scars has reopened, which is counterproductive. Since this isn’t its intended purpose, I can’t really fault it there. I also tried using it around my eyes, but there was no reduction in my facial lines. Maybe if you keep using it over a long period of time on fine lines, you could see some benefit. For me, I stopped using it once I got peeling.",2

CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum",3.0,"Before I tried this product I read reviews and many people recommended it.  I have ridiculously sensitive skin and was a little nervous about trying it but decided to take a chance since the description said it was fragrance free and gentle, non irritating formula.  I've used other CeraVe products with mixed results.  I started out slow with this serum to give my skin a chance, using only once a week.  Unfortunately, my skin reacted to it each time and I could never build up to more than once a week.  Each person's skin issues are different so I think it's up to each person to try the product and decide for themselves.

No major changes (so far)",3.0,"No major changes to my face after using about half the bottle.  But can't necessarily blame the product.  First, these things aren't some magic cure all.  Second, these things take time.  Third, you definitely have to use it as part of a bigger system to get the best results (drink more water, moisturize, sunscreen, etc.).  And fourth, I don't pay attention to the finest of fine lines that might have been reduced so far.  But no adverse reactions and it goes on/applies easily.",0

Not so sure about this yet",3.0,"I'm 60 with dry, sensitive skin. This serum is more like a thin lotion. I've been using it once daily for 2 weeks, and so far it seems it's making my wrinkles more pronounced :( - but I've had this same problem before using another very high-end retinol serum - their beauty consultant told me sometimes there's ""bad"" before there's a good outcome using retinol. I quit using the high-end serum and my skin went back to looking better. I'm thinking the same of this serum but I don't want to look worse. On the plus side, it's truly fragrance-free and it isn't sticky...it also doesn't cause any irritation. I don't think this serum is for ME, but it may be fine for YOU.",7
