Fantastic Retinol Serum. Now I have a new skin that I totally love.",5.0,"This retinol is fantastic. My skin looks way better than before I started using it. It’s feels softer and radiant. I simply love it.Just remember this is not meant to be used around your eyes; it can irritate your skin and cause a burning sensation; it happened to me. Also, I use this Retinol serum only at nights, and in the morning I use the Vitamin serum; it’s not recommended to use both together. And the most important thing is to always use face sunscreen as part of your skincare routine.",3

You don't have to believe me...",5.0,"You really don't have to believe me. But I've used thousands of dollars of skincare products searching for the perfect retinol. Keep in mind that I've been prescribed tretinoin for wrinkles prevention and not acne, so I also have skin that is very very accustomed to retinol and retinoids so I no longer experience super sensitivity or purging. But I have had reactions to other ingredients in other retinol serums and products. I have been using this brand for their sunblock which goes as high as SPF 100. I use for myself and my children, they have some that are safe for young babies. They're amazing. But I always associated expense with quality. So I figured if this was $40 for a retinol serum there was no way that it would be as amazing as I was looking for. I tried EVRRYTHING. serums and systems that are easily $100+ from 111Skin, Murad, Sunday Riley etc. But this serum blows them all out of the water. I've found some by Naturium that are also great but I prefer this one. And I went well out of my way to avoid that brand for moral reasons. But it seems I was very wrong about that brand and this serum. This has very potent retinol that has never irritated me. It doesn't have a heavy perfumed scent. Its clear and very easy to layer. It absorbs, it isn't greasy. It has never caused any pilling. It hasn't bothered my rosacea at all. Its well worth the money for me. I've already noticed a difference in the bounce my skin has and the depth of my lines. The bottle is a decent size and not much is needed at one time. I adore this stuff. But keep in mind that this is my personal experience for my skin. What works for one person may not work for another. I'm used to retinol and don't have sensitive skin. I can speak to the powerfulness of it and the fact that this is a legit La Roche-Posay product. And that it works for me. It doesn't dry my skin. Its amazing, and I just hope anyone who tries it has the same experience I do. But if you're new to retinol PLEASE research into it. About how to start and when, how much to use and what to use it with and not to use it with. But PLEASE only use this at night and PLEASE wear SPF every day. Everyone needs to be anyway, retinol or not. And your skin tone also doesn't matter. Wear your spf. Religiously.  If you're very into skincare, I am a Fitzpatrick type 1 or 2.  Retinol or retinoids can be so helpful for so many skincare issues. Like magic honestly. But it's not something to blindly dive into either. If you're used to retinol I can honestly say that this is easily the best one I've used.  Gold luck on your skincare journey, everyone!",410

A great boost to my routine",5.0,"This is serum is so good and you definitely get results from it. The first time I used it, I used far too much as I found it hard to distribute only a few drops across my entire face and neck so I used much more. But then I tried something that works so well. I use an anti aging serum from Lab Series and put that serum in the palm of my hand and add 3 drops of the LRP retinol to it and mix it up with my finger and then apply to face and neck. I find that easier to use the smaller amount of retinol which is all you really need. So it acts as sort of a booster to my other awesome serum.  I used to use LRP's Redermic R but this serum is so much better and easier for me to integrate into my routine.",26

Yes, this really is as good as they say.",5.0,"Took a sample to try out from a friend, was totally sold, got a bottle myself. I have fair, combination skin and live in a hot climate, so I use it all year long except for the four hottest months when the sun is the most active. Yes, even with SPF50 I could feel my face starting to burn while I was using this product, so I replaced it with a niacinamide serum for the symmer.So, what magic did it do? Well, the first few days it was horrid. I applied it onto clean skin, topped with light moisturizer, and went to bed. To say that my face got oily is to say nothing. It was practically a pancake. I had oil stains on my pillow for the first time in my life. Thankfully, I read about retinol and the way it works, so I kept using it and waiting to see what happens. After a few days, oil levels were back to normal. After 2 weeks I woke up to photoshopped skin. No, seriously. It’s never looked so good in my entire life. Smooth, blemish-free, unclogged pores, black dots almost completely gone. I wish I took before and after pictures. I had zero adverse reactions, my skin has no issues with retinol, which is great. Wish I could keep using it through the summer, but it’s just not worth the risk. So if you’re doubting whether this serum is worth the $$$ - yes, every single penny. I’ve had $100+ products that did nothing while this little gem just fixed my skin. I thought I’d just never be rid of those blemishes and bumps. Power to LRP&retinol!",75

Gentle, yet effective retinol",5.0,"I've been reticent to try retinol for years because I have sensitive skin.  After doing some research, I decided to try La Roche-Posay because I trust the brand.  After the first use, my skin did not get irritated!  I've been using it weekly for over two months and the difference is remarkable.  I've noticed my fine lines are diminishing and my pores look smaller.  My skin feels more firm and taut and the tone is more even.  I always had issues with my nose looking red and irritated; however, the retinol has helped even out the tone and exfoliate the pores. My biggest problem area was deepening lines on the outer corner of my eyes from being a side sleeper.  Retinol helps minimize the damage!  I apply a layer of retinol followed by moisturizer before I go to sleep and the lines aren't as bad/don't last for hours after I wake up. It keeps the skin dewy and more resilient. If you have sensitive skin, this is a great alternative to strong, prescription strength retinoids.",25

La Roche-Posay is the best!",5.0,"This serum doesn't make my sensitive skin irritated or flaky. It DOES make the texture smoother and my skin brighter. It feels silky going on (Don't use too much!! It's concentrated) after I cleanse (CeraVe cream cleanser) and tone with glycolic pads.Like any skin care, you have to be diligent AND patient. Change takes time! It took years to do that skin damage! It takes weeks or months to see real improvement.Highly recommend this serum and anything by this company. Reputable, excellent customer service, quality products. Do they cost a bit more? Yes. In skin care, you usually need to spend a bit more to see any real improvement. And wear SPF 30 broad spectrum even in the rain (yes, really. The UV rays are still there and still damaging!) and even going to your mailbox (before you EVER are exposed to outdoor light). You should anyway, but this is Retinol. Super photosensitive. Close tightly and store in a cool, dark place.",25

Works for what I needed",5.0,"As I got into my late 40’s, I started noticing flat bumps showing under my eyes. I researched it, and turns out it’s common in women my age. Retinol was recommended, or going to a Dermatologist for a freezing procedure to have them removed. I tried this first. Used it for about 6 weeks, and the number of bumps has decreased. Just ordered more. Love this stuff.",3

Fine for sensitive skin.  It helps.",5.0,This is very much a serum it does not add any moisture it sucks right into the skin I think it really helps on the spots nothing is going to illuminate anything but it helps fade  them.  I  use a moisturizer over it.  I also use it in alternating with vitamin c and glycolic acid,14
