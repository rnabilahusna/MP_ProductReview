Good!",4.0,"Ran out of one retinol and decided to switch to this and it's good. No major difference in skin. Moisturizes and is a good serum. Still had a retinol purge, but wasn't too bad. Do not use if you have eczema. Scent is neutral.",27

Bamboozled into buying this from a YouTube Influencer...",4.0,"I am getting older and my neck is getting a little wrinkly.  So I searched YouTube for ways to take care of it.  I found this Influencer who was a 57 years old man and did a helpful video on Face Yoga.  He recommended this cream as well.  I thought he looked so young for his age and was instantly willing to buy the cream.  I showed my husband the video and was raving about how young this guy looked, when my husband interrupted me and said that the guy was totally using a filter!  Lol!  The cream is nice and light.  It tightens up the skin a little, but didn't live up to the claim of the YouTuber I watched!  I use the CeraVe moisturizer cream and I probably could have just stuck with that.  Not convinced that the retinol helps much more than regular moisturizer.",3

Good product",4.0,This product is nice but it is very drying. I would say to def ease into using the product everyday. I started with once a week then twice and so on. I've been using it now for about 5 weeks and I wouldn't say I see any results. I'm going to continue to use it and I hope I can see a difference soon.,0

Not a magic fix",4.0,"I starting using this retinol 6 months ago, and I definitely see a difference in my skin. My fine lines are less noticeable and my skin tone has evened out a little bit. It does take time for your skin to get used to using this (mine took almost two months before I stopped breaking out). I would recommend this to people who are looking for a long term product that will make a difference over a long period of time.",4

Cerave Anti Aging Retinol Serum Really Does Work",4.0,"I noticed that the lines on my forehead and around my mouth were reduced as soon as I applied it compared to the previous product I was using.

Not as expected",4.0,"I am in my 40’s and not new to retinol products. I like the CeraVe product line and just discovered it had a retinol option. If I use my regular amount of product it doesn’t feel like adequate coverage. If I use slightly more this will completely zap my face, over-drying it out. Could be I haven’t found that sweet spot of product amount for me, or it could be this is just not a good retinol for me. Regardless it is the first CeraVe product that doesn’t live up to stellar expectations. I’ll finish this bottle, but probably won’t be purchasing again.",6

Dermatologist Recommended",4.0,"I am older and told the dermatologist I was tired of using all sorts of different products and spending a lot of money on facial creams, lotions, serums, etc. that just waste my time and money.

Evened my skin tone and texture",4.0,"After using this product for about 2 months, I can say the improvement in my skin tone and texture - while subtle - is noticeable. My skin has an overall more dewy look that I like, and I find myself wearing less or no concealer because I’m not trying to artificially even out blotchy spots. At the beginning and after reading some other reviews I started with every other day application only to avoid irritation. After maybe about a week I started applying every day and never had any issues with irritation, redness, dryness, etc. I have pretty sensitive skin and have found this product really easy to use. I will definitely buy it again and keep using it to see if the subtle but noticeable effects grow with time.",4

Really clears up minor discoloration and makes skin feel new and delicate but not quite raw. You really need to be careful and do use this more than once a week. A little goes a long way. And please remember to use SPF after you use this!! Best way to use it to apply at night and then wash off in the morning and replace with SPF moisturizer.

It has no scent at all and is easy to dispense.I'd like to say that my skin is looking better, however because of the pandemic and working from home, I haven't worn make up for 9+ months so that might be a factor as well.

helps slough off old skin, can get a little harsh",4.0,"As much as I liked this CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum, it sloughs off dead skin cells so effectively that I wasn't able to use it prior to putting on makeup, and after a few days it did start causing some stinging. I've dropped to using it twice a week and it doesn't sting, but I'm not sure I'm getting the full benefit from it.My current routine is to cleanse, then use Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence, then The Original hyaluronic acid & B5 on the face with The Original Caffeine Solution 5% under the eyes. Then I use a serum, and on top of that is the moisturizer, usually Philosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar.I replaced my usual serum with CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum and immediately realized I could not pair this with the Ordinary hyaluronic acid, it was too much for my skin. So I skipped that the next day and it improved the stinging, but pretty big flakes of skin were coming off as I used the CeraVe. Since I gently exfoliate when I cleanse, I'm not sure what was coming off, but I think it was too much because a few days later the stinging came back.Now I've changed my routine so that I use hyaluronic acid 5 days a week and CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum two days a week, everything seems balanced, but I don't think I notice a huge difference. I think that you need to use this CeraVe more often to see the anti aging benefits and my skin just can't handle it.I do like CeraVe products and even my husband uses their moisturizer, so I'm going to keep experimenting.",4

Retinol needs long term use",4.0,"I am willing to try just about any product for my face that ""claims"" it will improve my skin. Mostly I use Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I, in fact, have the CeraVe Hyaluronic product. I though this Retinol product would be the same stuff, but it is NOT. It comes in the same type of dispenser, but the cream is different. I applied both serums at night, one cheek one, the other cheek the other. When I washed in the morning the Hyaluronic product had a creamy residue that felt like I was applying it again, the Retinol product did not. I really didn't see a difference on my face after only one use. Anti-Aging products all make claims, but you don't know if you are picking what's best for you. Retinol claims to improve fine lines and wrinkles. They don't say this can only be accomplished over time. My one use didn't show to much change. On the plus side, I had no adverse effects. It was a very nice cream, and proved not to be too harsh on my face. Hyaluronic Acid claims it absorbs moisture. I know it dries into my skin after applying it, so I'd say that claim is true. I have decided that although these two products come packaged similarly, they are not the same product. I think a person can use both, not either/or. I am going to continue with the Hyaluronic product because I already know it works, but I am going to start putting on this Retinol once a week because if there is any benefit to be gotten from long term use, I am going to try to get it.",17

Also good for men. A little goes a long way.",4.0,"I have tried a couple of other products by Cerave before and both were okay, specially for the price. This skin renewing retinol serum's pump delivery system ensures that the contents are not in contact with air to retain its effectivity. This dispenser also helps me remember that a small amount of this serum goes a long way.I like how its non-comedogenic so I don't have to worry about breaking out. It doesn't irritate the skin on my face and it doesn't have any unnecessary added scents. I prefer to know it's there but not have any lingering scent to remind me.Like other similar products that address aging issues, it takes long term use and consistency to determine its effectivity so I had to take a star off because it's really too soon to tell. Otherwise, I haven't had any negative effects by using this product.",2

CeraVe is the best!!",4.0,"I love CeraVe products, they are gentle and great for dry and sensitive skin, or really any skin type! I have several CeraVe moisturizers and cleansers that I love, so was happy to try out their retinol serum! I've used a few other brands' retinol products with mixed results. My main complaint with any serum or cream is when it is slow to absorb or pills. I have never had this issue with CeraVe products, and did not have it with this one either. The serum absorbs quickly, leaving a soft and not sticky finish.",2

Mixed results",4.0,"I'm a big fan of most CeraVe products, but this one doesn't work as well for me. While my skin is dry now that I'm in my 60's, I continued to have acne most of my adult life.  I don't generally have breakouts now, but I can only use the lightest of moisturizers.This retinol serum is rich and and like a lotion. When it first goes on it feels sticky, but that doesn't last. I've had good results from it on my cheeks, but it makes my chin and forehead break out so I've learned to be careful about where I apply it.",2

Great light moisturizer",4.0,"As far as wrinkle reduction,  I'm unsure. With this kind of product,  I feel that they probably need months of constant use to see anything.  I have used this twice a day for a week. While my wrinkles have not magically disappeared,  I have been enjoying the light moisturizer.  I break out and have sensitive skin. While this initially makes my face turn slightly red, it calms down and is a great moisturizer that doesn't feel oily or break me out. If you have ultra sensitive skin, the slight burn feel at first may be too much for you.",7

Chemical smell",4.0,"I’m not as impressed with this Cera Ve cream serum as I am with most of their other products. This yellow tinted cream has a decided chemical smell that I find off putting. Also, it doesn’t absorb readily, with the silky feel of other creams made by the brand. It does seem to hydrate well, however. I will try alternating it with another serum, but it’s likely that I’ll dispose of it due to the smell.",2

Gentle on my skin. No sticky residue.",4.0,"I'm liking this CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum because it's gentle on my skin, and doesn't sting or burn. It's absorbed pretty quickly and doesn't leave any sticky feeling residue.  I apply just a small amount (about a finger tips worth) twice daily. A small amount really goes a long way. I can't wait to see the outcome in the long run.",3

Has ceramides for rebuilding..",4.0,"I haven't used this for a long enough period to say there are ""overnight results"", but...My skin feels moisturized, pores smaller and overall tighter (?).  Maybe I should say refined?  I'm in my 60's so I don't expect to be ridden of all my ""happy"" lines but, there is a smoothness to the finish of my skin like the lines are not as deep.  I think the retinol is the action part of the serum and the ceramides help fill in + then hold moisture in.  Like this so far and this is a quality company from everything I've read & experienced",4

good so far",4.0,Retinol is hard to review because of using multiple products at the same time. This one doesn't burn and can be used daily on my somewhat sensitive skin which is a huge plus. So far so good,10

Smooths facial skin",4.0,"Every once in a while, I get rough skin around my mouth and chin.  Age thing, I suppose.  This gets rid of it and the effect lasts about 2 weeks.  Then it comes back and I use this for 2-3 days at night and voila - it goes away again.  I suppose I should use it more often, but I have never been one for a skin care routine.  Docked one star because it did not take 10 years off my appearance.  I am 60, and I could've used that.",0

Too little",4.0,"Not bad for wrinkles, and the brand itself is reliable. I took a star off because even though I knew it will be small because it’s only one ounce. But I didn’t expected it will be this small lol. But anyway, I love this brand",2
