Not the same as used to be",1.0,"So this was for few years my favorite cream. I know the texture and how it feels after applying it on my face. Some weeks ago Amazon went back to lower (the usual $15) price and I got three bottles. How disappointing it was to discover this is a completely different cream that I felt immediately and does nothing for my skin. I'm learning to check the ''most recent'' reviews instead of ""top 'reviews.  Very disappointed and looking for another product.",0

Warning Regarding Seller -- Product is great",1.0,"If you check who the seller is and you see Global Transport be very careful. I ordered the product and received it in a damaged (previously opened) box that was missing the paperwork normally contained in said box. I suspect that the product, at the least had been used, and no telling if tampered with or not. The product itself is a good one, I know as I have used it before many times, but do be wary of using this seller in the future. Learned my lesson, CHECK SELLER's NAME!!!UPDATE - The seller did refund my purchase price when made aware of the issue nut I would still be wary of buying from this seller in the future.",10

I recently developed psoriosis, and purchased numerous of the products from CeraVe.  I like them all, except this one.  Smells strong, and does not really give me a nice feeling when applied, like a serum should.  Tried it a few times, will not use it again.",0

Totally DRYING",1.0,"I didn't realize that retinol really dries out your skin! The skin under my eyes got red and looked MORE wrinkly after using this. Also, if you do use retinol, make sure you use a good sunscreen during the day, because it will make your skin far more susceptible to sunburn.I can't use this stuff. Not sure how it helps with aging skin if it dries it out.",4

A COMPLETE LET DOWN.",1.0,"I have used several retinol serums.  This serum is not my favorite.  I love the CeraVE line overall, but this product does not live up to the brands quality.  The consistency is greasy and it doesn't absorb well leaving a sticky layer on your face.  It feels and looks like mucus.  I used this serum for several months and saw minimal results.  It's rare I get a reaction from skincare products.  However I woke up several mornings with blemishes on my face since using it.  As a licensed Esthetician who has been in the industry for several years, I have to say RETINOL PRODUCTS ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.  If you want real results I recommend consulting a Dermatologist about a low does prescription of Retin-A topical cream and mix it in with your moisturizer at night.  Retin-A is highly effective when addressing anti-aging when used properly under the supervision of a dermatologist.  Whatever Retinol or Retin-A product you use, it  is crucial you only use them at night before bed and apply sunscreen regularly during the day even when it's overcast or cloudy. Overall, I'd encourage you to explore other products as this one isn't very effective.  I hope this feedback helps.",180

This product resulted in the irritation of my skin (red, inflamed and itchy skin) and resulted in the loss of many hair follicles -- creating bald patches.

Be cautious when trying this product...",1.0,"Be cautious when trying this product. If your skin reacts like mine did, stop trying it!I was incredibly excited about this product because it contained “retinal” and the price was very affordable. However when trying this product on before bed, I woke up the next morning to cracked peeling skin. A review i read said this was normal for it to peel and the directions say it’s safe to use every night. I continued to use for 2 more nights. It was very harsh and damaging to my skin. I stoped using completely because my skin was hurting, irritating, broken out and patchy. I’m not the type to have sensitive skin. I would consider myself to have more dry skin than oily but i have never had my skin react like it did when trying this product. I have tan skin, it’s going to take me months to recover from the scars this has caused me.",24

Product did not work for me.",1.0,"Ive used Cerave for many years and decided to try the retinol to take my skin to the next level. I currently use the Cerave Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser twice a day. Then the Cerave Facial Moisturizing Lotion AM & PM. When i added the retinol to my routine, before applying the lotion at night, multiple pimples appeared the next morning. My initial thought was maybe, I should use it in the daytime instead of night. So after my face cleared up, I tried a the same amount as before but this time in the morning and I had the same result. I believe this is one of those products that works for some but not for all.",4

This product hasn't done a thing to reduce the look of my little line-- maybe it's my imagination but I swear the line is more defined. Most retinol products cause dryness and flaking and while this does not, I'm convinced there's not enough retinol in here to do anything. I like Cerave products in general but this is a complete waste of money and it isn't cheap! Plus side, I haven't noticed any acne or adverse skin effects.",12

No change in skin's appearance",1.0,"I am middle-aged and have tried various face and eye creams with hopes of having younger-looking skin. This CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum became available in my Amazon Vine selection, so I wanted to give it a try.  After I received it, I realized it is extremely similar to a CeraVe product I recently tried called CeraVe Skin Renewing CREAM Serum, which also contained Retinol.  Interesting to me, the claims on the packages vary slightly with “HELPS REDUCE the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” on the cream serum and “REDUCES the look of fine lines and wrinkles” on this serum.I have used this CeraVe Retinol Serum for about a month now, and have not seen any change in my skin’s appearance.  I used the other CeraVe serum for 3 months and didn’t notice any changes either.  Maybe I’m expecting too much from these anti-aging serums, but none of them seem to do anything other than moisturize. I have used creams for weeks or even months, but the wrinkles, age spots and skin texture/tone all look the same to me. I will pass on this one … and keep on trying",34
