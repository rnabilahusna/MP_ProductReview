Delaying the inevitable",3.0,"Figured I’d try this brand’s rentinol since I love their vitamin c and the droppers fit my bathroom aesthetic like a boss, but I prefer the texture and smell of my it retinol cream. The texture feels a little sticky to me and no real scent which as a smell-every-candle type of lady, I find offensive",3

Not overly impressed",3.0,"I really wanted to love this product, but I really just like it a little. For me it hasn’t seemed to make a difference in my skin texture and appearance. I prefer the Neutrogena retinol serum to this product, which is what I was using prior. The Neutrogena seems to be stronger in the Retinol percentage, although I don’t know that for sure as the La Roche doesn’t disclose the amount of retinol in its product. I can say that the smell is pleasant however it is a little sticky feeling on my face.",0

I don't see a difference",3.0,About halfway through the bottle and I'm not seeing much of a difference. I'll finish it up but probably won't buy again. It was very pricey for what you get.,3

Not sure",3.0,"I just received the product so I can’t make a comment about how it works. The box came completely damaged and on the bottle where it has the expiration date and the lot number it is completely blank. Is that normal? Also, there was no protective wrap around the bottle so I had concerns that it had been previously used??",5

Packaging in poor condition, serum nice and slippy",3.0,"The packaging arrived in poor condition, very dinged up, crumpled, and slightly open. It made me a bit nervous about using the product inside, because although the glass bottle was intact, it was hard to tell if it had been previously opened.The serum itself had a lovely feel to it, nice and slippy, and it absorbed well without being sticky. I also liked the scent, as while technically unscented, the ingredients used do have some fragrance to them. In the brief time I used it, I did notice some improvements to my skin. Ultimately though, I was not able to effectively incorporate it into my skincare routine, and so I can't speak to long-term benefits.",0

Perfumed! I don’t like that",3.0,"I only just got this at a department store, had been wanting to try a retinol serum and then this jumped out at me on clearance. I can’t speak to how well it works because I only just started using it, but what I can speak on is the scent. This serum is perfumed and I really really do not like using anything on my face that is perfumed. So even if I do end up liking this stuff I’ll look for a different one that is fragrance free",0

Doesn't work for me.",3.0,I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks now and I'm not noticing much of a change.  I have used this on my entire face but I also focus on dark problematic areas and they are still pretty dark.I like that this doesn't make my face breakout. It also gives your face a tingly sensation when you apply it.I'm going to try to use this a little longer and see if it helps the spots pictured. If I see any improvement I'll update this.  It just doesn't seem to be doing anything to my face so far.,4
