CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum - A Potent Skincare Game-Changer",5.0,"CeraVe's Anti Aging Retinol Serum stands as a formidable addition to any skincare routine, harnessing the power of retinol to deliver transformative results. As an enthusiast of skincare products, I was eager to put this serum to the test, and it did not disappoint.Firstly, what sets CeraVe apart is its commitment to gentle yet effective formulations, catering to a wide spectrum of skin types. This serum, enriched with encapsulated retinol and ceramides, presents a potent yet non-irritating formula suitable for sensitive skin—a rare gem in the world of retinol-based treatments.Upon incorporating this serum into my nightly routine, I noticed visible improvements in my skin's texture and tone within weeks. The encapsulated retinol ensures a gradual release, minimizing the likelihood of irritation while maximizing efficacy. The serum effortlessly sinks into the skin, leaving behind a hydrated and plump feel without any greasiness—a testament to its lightweight and non-comedogenic nature.One of the serum's standout qualities is its multitasking ability. Not only does it diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but it also tackles uneven skin tone and promotes a youthful radiance. Its gentle nature makes it suitable for consistent use, ensuring long-term benefits without the discomfort commonly associated with retinol products.Moreover, the addition of ceramides fortifies the skin's natural barrier, enhancing moisture retention and aiding in the reduction of redness and irritation often experienced with retinol use.While individual results may vary, I can confidently attest to the noticeable improvements in my skin's overall appearance, lending it a smoother, more youthful glow. It seamlessly integrates into my skincare regimen, complementing other products without causing any adverse reactions.In conclusion, CeraVe's Anti Aging Retinol Serum is a game-changer for those seeking an effective yet gentle retinol treatment. Its ability to address multiple skin concerns while remaining suitable for sensitive skin makes it a standout product in the realm of anti-aging skincare. Highly recommended for anyone looking to rejuvenate their complexion with a reliable, dermatologist-recommended formulation.",84

Smoother, brighter, and more youthful-looking skin!",5.0,"CeraVe’s Anti Aging Retinol Serum is a powerhouse skincare product that has become a must-have in my routine. Here’s why it’s worth considering:1. Effective Ingredients: This serum is packed with key ingredients like Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, and Ceramides, which are known for their ability to address multiple skincare concerns. Retinol is fantastic for smoothing fine lines and promoting skin renewal, Hyaluronic Acid provides deep hydration, Niacinamide helps even out skin tone, and Ceramides strengthen the skin’s barrier.2. Gentle and Non-Irritating: CeraVe is well-regarded for creating products suitable for sensitive skin, and this serum is no exception. Despite containing potent ingredients like Retinol, it’s gentle and unlikely to cause irritation when used as directed.3. Skin Brightening: Over time, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin’s brightness and texture. Fine lines have become less noticeable, and my complexion appears more even and youthful.4. Hygienic Packaging: The serum comes in a pump bottle, ensuring hygienic and precise dispensing of the product. It’s also easy to control the amount you use.5. Affordable Luxury: This serum offers high-quality skincare at an affordable price point, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers.One thing to keep in mind is that Retinol products can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so it’s crucial to use sunscreen during the day while using this serum.In conclusion, CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum is an exceptional addition to your skincare routine. It combines powerful ingredients to target multiple skin concerns while remaining gentle on sensitive skin. With regular use, you can expect smoother, brighter, and more youthful-looking skin.",105

OTC Retinol That Moisturises",5.0,"I love all of Cerave's products, and this one is one of my all-time favorites. Yes, it may be a drugstore product, but that doesn't bother me I'm not a skincare snob. I have been using Cerave's Retinol for a long time now and not only does it absorb quickly but is so soothing for aging dry skin. I apply it every night during my skincare regimen and this product is very soothing and moisturizing. It is extremely inexpensive yet has many good ingredients and no fragrance, scent, or smell so it is great for those with sensitive skin or scent allergies. Please do not be deceived by the low price tag, this is a very special product and will not only moisturize your skin but works to keep wrinkles at bay. I absolutely recommend this gentle yet effective product at a fabulous price point to anyone seeking an OTC retinol product that won't dry out your skin, you have nothing to lose except perhaps a few wrinkles, and who doesn't want that? I have used Tretinoin but I keep coming back to Cerave because my aging dry skin loves it:)",105

Retinol",5.0,This is a great way to introduce retinol without the harsh effects. It's a really easy to apply serum. I don't think the results are seen as quickly as straight retinol but the fact that this isn't as harsh makes it worth it. I can't use retinol because I break out in a rash. But this I can use. I love anything CeraVe. Highly recommend!,0

It really works!!",5.0,I’ve been using Cera ve and 5 other of their  products for about a month now- morning routine & evening routine they show in their description. About 2 months ago my 6 yr old granddaughter (out of the blue) told me I looked like I was 81( im 57). My health is poor and admittedly I have been letting my facial routine go. So needless to say I read allot of reviews of other products and landed on this one. What a huge difference in 4-5 weeks! My fine lines have diminished and my puffy eyes are improving. Granddaughter just told me I look 74 now lol. So something is working. I love these products💕💕,18

After much internet rummaging and finding this had great reviews, I purchased, tried, and my final opinion is that it works great for me (I would guess that I have normal skin, sometimes it can be slightly oily but not by much).  I get compliments on my complexion again, which had stopped when my skin started to age.I always use sunblock when I use this product as my morning routine, also from CeraVe.  I assume since it has retinol, its that more essential to use sunblock to protect the newer, exposed, skin.",24

This product really works!",5.0,"I have never used any retinol or hyluronic acid products.  But for the last few months, I was stressing over the vertical lines around my mouth and even consulted with a dermatologist about a painful and expensive laser procedure.  I happened to come across Dr. Sugai, a no nonsense dermatologist on YouTube, and after seeing his review of several retinol products, I went ahead and ordered his number one recommendation—CeraVe retinol serum.  He mentioned that retinol and the  hyluronic acid that is part of the serum  have  a slight plumping effect but I thought it was just a bit of hype.  But he seemed to know what he was talking about so I thought I’d give it a try.  I’m so glad I did!  After a couple of days of using the serum, I looked in the mirror and thought WHOA! —this stuff  really works!  He was spot on re the plumping effect.  It wasn’t hype after all.  For now I’m holding off on doing any laser procedures.  I only used a tiny  amount around my mouth and had  no adverse reaction to my sensative skin.",59

I actually really like this product",5.0,"I didn’t expect to care enough about it to leave a review, but I have to say, it’s been the perfect introduction into retinol products.It’s got a silky moisturizing feel, and after using it for only two weeks, my skin is already looking a bit brighter, smaller pores, more even tone.. Nothing crazy, but I can definitely see a difference. Looking forward to continued use and I’m sure even better results. I have combination dry skin, and I’ve had no irritation. I put it on after my serums, and before my moisturizer at night (I don’t skimp either, I use plenty of it and work it into face/neck/chest). Love the way it makes my skin feel and look in the AM 👍🏼",20

Great for a beginner",5.0,"I’m 37 years old and moved across the country to a much drier climate and my skin was like a lizard! I never had dry skin before but started to notice my face was looking dull and even flaky under makeup. I was curious about retinol and nervous since I’ve had sensitivity to products in the past, but this one has hyaluronic acid which is meant to offset any reactions so I gave it a go. Started only applying at night and after only 3 nights I’ve already noticed such an improvement in the texture and appearance of my face!! My ilia tinted serum now glides on smoothly and the flakes are gone. No redness or issues. Glad I opted for this trusted brand and didn’t try to go for a pricier potentially harsher option.",35

Extremely pleased",5.0,"I’d never tried cerave before but was googling about good moisturizer for dry skin. And I wanted something with ceramides and niacinamides  so I was super happy to find this. It has helped my skin a lot. The irritation and redness diminished, my skin feels so smooth any soft and it’s easy to put make up on over it. The only issue i have is it soaks into the skin so well, I feel like I have to put some more on!  But very moisturizing!!",13

My new go to",5.0,"I really love this product because I have tried other retinol products before and haven't been happy with how they have left my skin feeling. My past experiences with other brands have left my skin flaky and feeling dry but with this product I have had none of those issues. I like that it includes Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, and Ceramides to help restore your skin's natural barriers which I believe the previous products were lacking. I was hesitant to try this product because I have tried CeraVe cleansing products in the past and they have caused my skin to breakout but I'm happy to report that this particular product did not cause any breakouts for me.",23

Overall, I feel like the product has done its job and helped a little with my dark spots and skin overall.

Excellent Product -- Beware of One Seller",5.0,"As an older man, I've found that this retinol serum -- although it doesn't say what percentage or quantity of retinol is in the serum -- seems to help reduce and prevent facial skin spots that are common in aging; and at a relatively good price compared to many retinol products.  However, if you find that ""HappyLife4Me"" (but not for you) is to be your Amazon seller, beware.  In my experience, they were unreliable -- at best -- and I won't do any more business with them.  It'd be nice if the product was shipped directly from CeraVe or Amazon, but it can also be found at common drugstores and grocery stores.",49
