"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: CeraVe Eye Cream for Wrinkles | Under Eye Cream with Caffeine, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, and Ceramides for Fine Lines | Fragrance Free &amp; Ophthalmologist Tested |0.5 Ounces",14/12/2023,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Moisturizing and Absorbs Quickly",5.0,"This is a great eye cream. It’s kind of thick, like a balm. It is easily spreadable on the skin and absorbs like a dream. I kept squeezing the tube for more to apply to other areas of my face and neck.This is fragrance free. It played well underneath a layer of sunscreen (no pilling or balling up and shedding).I prefer this over the more fluid Cetaphil Eye Serum. This absorbs quicker, moisturizes, and does not sting my eyes.I do not see an improvement in under eye dark circles. I did not expect to see a dramatic difference for under eye darkness. I focus more on how well this moisturizes the skin around my eye.The texture of this eye cream is firmer than Aquaphor Healing Ointment. It spreads easier than Aquaphor Healing Ointment and does not leave a glossy shine. This is lightweight and moisturizing and works well for both the summer time and winter.I recommend putting Cerave moisturizing cream on a damp face (to lock in the moisture), wait 3 minutes for it to sink in, and then apply this around the eyes. I like this so much that I use it on my entire face and neck. It’s not as greasy as Aquaphor.Tip: Apply this around your nails cuticles to keep cuticles moisturized. More effective than cuticle oil and no mess.RECOMMENDATION: BUY. This is lightweight, absorbs quickly and easily, is fragrance-free, and moisturizing.",49

My undereyes love it",5.0,Have been using this for a couple weeks and can tell a difference in moisture and puffiness.  My eyes look more awake and less swollen in the morning.

fly away crows feet",5.0,"I am a skeptic with a lot of the anti-aging products out there, but also a sucker.  This one, IMO, is worth the hype.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and man oh man, I can see the difference.  I have even applied to my laugh lines to see if it helps at all there recently.  It is a little more drying on that section of my face for some reason, but it is great around the eyes. 10 out of 10.",25

It improves firmness and hydration",5.0,"I've tried a range of eye creams, I decided to give this a chance with no big expectations, but after using a couple of times, when I touch my undereye area the skin feels firm, tighter, and hydrated. If your issue is skin laxity this will help, now dont expect hyperpigmentation or purple color to go away, you need vitamin C or green tea for that. The texture of the crean is thick which I love, gives you a sense of a ""barrier"" being placed.",0

Love this product!",5.0,"I have extremely sensitive/picky skin. Usually eye creams cause me to break out a bit in the applied area. I've been using No. 7 lift and luminate but I didn't feel it was doing much, wrinkle wise. I don't have many or deep wrinkles but it still didn't feel like it was doing anything for the area. I decided to try this product out (first day using was yesterday) and what a surprise! The area it was applied to feels tighter and stronger instead of soft. I am absolutely in love with this. AND it has no scent. 10/10 review",0

My first eye cream",5.0,"I'm 46 and this is the first eye cream I've ever purchased.  I noticed the skin under eyes looking dry and what creases I have were more noticeable due to the dryness.  I purchased it because of the reviews and most importantly, because it is fragrance free.  I've been using this about a week and under my eyes looks more moisturized, my fine lines show up less and the darkness in the inner corner of my eyes seem less pronounced.  I don't feel as ""blah"" now when I'm not wearing makeup because that area of my face just seems brighter.  I'll definitely be repurchasing this.  It wears well underneath my makeup.",7

I apply this regularly to my eyes and have used it for a few weeks now and plan to buy again as soon as I run out of this bottle. It provides needed moisture and my skin around my eyes has been visibility plumper, with less dry lines. I especially get flaky skin in my eyebrows, and this has helped tremendously there, as well.I've never used a dedicated eye cream, so have nothing to compare it too, but given my sensitivities, I'd rather stick with what works!",24

Very easy on the eyes",5.0,"I am a big CeraVe fan. My dermatologist recommended this brand.  I use their daily moisturizer with sunscreen and their night cream.  This eye cream is REALLY nice.  It is not scented but a nice creamy texture.  I use it day and night and it really smooths out a lot of my under eye wrinkles.  I massage it on outward x 10 and it plumps up my lower eyes really nice.  It even takes away some of the puffiness.  Love it.  Wish it was in a bigger tube as these smaller tubes tend to be expensive for the size.  I am 72 y/o and believe in retinol, a Vitamin C serum (I make my own), a sunscreen and a nighttime moisturizer.  My husband says my skin looks really nice.  I got lotta sun growing up in SoCal, the CeraVe covers over a multitude of sun damage.  Great product.",58

Works perfectly! Better than expected!",5.0,"This brightens my dark circles and tightens the skin under my eyes; it always makes me look refreshed.At first I was kinda weirded out because I thought I looked so different with my dark circles barely visible, but quickly got used to it. The difference is that noticeable. Some people’s skin might react differently, so it’s hard to say if it’ll be as effective but if anything will brighten circles, this is it. Good value, good product.The cream has no scent and you just need to apply a small amount, I use something like a half grain of rice size drop and rub it in until it’s absorbed.- 26 year old male",21

Luxury not a need",5.0,I use this every night to help prevent wrinkles & brighten my under eyes. You only need VERY little to use this product. I gave a comparison for reference as to how small the squeeze container is for anyone who is questioning. I only just started this about 10 days ago so I see no real difference yet but again it's only been 10 days and aging takes a while. I'm getting into more skin care & self care so this is more of a luxury item for myself rather than a need.,16

It is good",5.0,"I’ve been using eye cream over the years and honestly I never found any improvement. I had to do fillers to have a real improvement. However, this lotion is a plus.

I feel under my eyes much more illuminate and less “tired” appearance. You should give it a try. A lot of eye creams do not work. I tried skinmedica and alastin and was not worth the money.
