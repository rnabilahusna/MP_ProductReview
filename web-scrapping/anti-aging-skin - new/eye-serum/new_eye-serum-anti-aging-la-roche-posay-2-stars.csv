Overpriced concealer",2.0,"First, the box arrived all smashed. There's no seal on the actual tube so I have no idea if this thing is supposed to be like that or they're shipping a returned tube. Bad either way.The actual cream, this is essentially an overpriced concealer, and not a very good one. It left the area under my eyes dry and the pigment getting in the creases like make up applied without a primer or moisturizer. Yes the dark circles are less prominent but that's because it's light make up. I would not recommend this or buy this again.",2

Didn’t see results",2.0,I’m not sure this really works. I didn’t see any results even after two months of use. But the cold metal applicator feels nice when you apply so I gave an extra star for that alone.,5

Beware if you have sensitive skin!",2.0,"Caused a reaction for me. Product burns when applied. Also leaves behind a white film that I thought was my skin flaking off, but it just the product.I do not recommend if you have sensitive skin!",2

But it seemed like a decent product",2.0,"I am allergic to most under eye creams and this was no exception.  But it seemed like a decent product.  I think the more a cream attempts to do, the more I am allergic to it.",0

Dark Circles Continue to Flourish",2.0,"I'm not sure how La Roche can claim this product reduces the dark circles.  I thought the metal applicator was the revolutionary process plus maybe the caffeine.  Not so.  It may be used as a concealer and, as such, it's not light enough for me.  I tried it several times, morning and night and found no difference.  I added a concealer on top of this product and it seemed to work better but, honestly, I couldn't tell if it was the combination of the two with the added enhancement of another texture.The pigmenatclar has a smooth texture and the actual case is sturdy and of high quality.  Unfortunately, it was not the miracle to erase years of genetics, age or irregular skin tones",4

A good wrinkle cream but doesn't help shadows",2.0,"My wife tried this cream for a week and was disappointed. She says it was moisturizing and she didn’t have to use much to smooth lines, but even when she used a lot it didn’t help the shadows.  She was happy that it didn’t have any fragrance and didn’t make her eyes water or itch.  She doesn’t plan to buy more though.",2
