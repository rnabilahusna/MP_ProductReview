Clumps and rubs off",2.0,Very disappointed. This eye cream is highly rated and I'm so disappointed. IT RUBS OFF and CLUMPS UP around the eyes. That means it's NOT absorbing into my skin. It's just caking up and sitting on top of it.I'm a big fan of CeraVe lotions & their bath bar but this is horrible. Save your money. Going back to my tried & true Clinique.,0

Grainy",2.0,This is not at all creamy or light.  Really did nothing for me.  The consistency is like toothpaste when you first squeeze it out.

The First CeraVe Product That Irritates My Skin",2.0,"I have slowly transitioned to all CeraVe products over the past year.  Day and night moisturizers, cleansers - my sensitive, easily irritated skin loves it all.Until using this eye cream.It's definitely thick, smoothes on easily.  But it stings when I use it.  And I don't mean I accidentally get some in my eyes and it stings - it actually irritates my skin.  Which is a shame because I really wanted to like it.For now I'll continue using my CV night facial moisturizer, which works just fine and doesn't sting or irritate.",0
