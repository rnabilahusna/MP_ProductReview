Meh…",3.0,I love LaRoche Posay products like their brightening face wash and the double moisturizer but this product is just okay. I didn’t see any result for puffiness reduction or dark circle minimization. The cooling applicator is nice but fleeting and you get a tinted moisturizer that looks like glitter under your eyes. I think I expected too much since I love my other products….,5

not worth it",3.0,"This pains me to write because I really love a lot of La Roche Posay products but I didnt find this product effective for me personally.  I was looking to address bluish dark circles and cross-referenced a lot of other similar products to make sure it was specific to my concern, so I had high hopes.  The actual tip is cold and I guess has a nice feel when you use it, and the product is somewhat of a concealer but not completely.  I've personally been thinking it would just be a better investment to buy a good concealing product if its mostly dark circles you want to correct. puffiness and fine lines may respond differently to other products.  Overall would not spend the money on this again.",38

I don't like that it is pigmented",3.0,I don't like that it is pigmented. I think due to that fact it has actually been drying out my under eye area. It gave me dry spots under my eyes that looked horrible with makeup. It took 2 weeks for the spots to clear back up with a different under eyes serum. I only give it 3 stars because it has worked okay for my husband.,3

However it is a nice concealer, and leaves the under-eye area soft",3.0,"I bought this because some reviews said it helps puffy eyes, in addition to dark circles. I have puffy eyes, especially in the morning due to allergies--for me, it didn't help either dark circles or puffiness. However it is a nice concealer, and leaves the under-eye area soft. With that being said, I'll use it until I run out, but I wouldn't buy it again, since there are good concealers out there that are less expensive.",5

I had high hopes for this eye cream and wish ...",3.0,"I had high hopes for this eye cream and  wish I would give it higher rating—but, alas, it has done little to nothing for my dark circles. It does help lubricate skin around the eyes, though, and thus the reason for my 3-star rating.",6

Neutral review, not worth the price",3.0,"I had received a sample of this elsewhere and really liked it. However, the product is a different than the sample, despite the name being the same. This full size product did not deliver anything special. It does not do any harm, but it does nothing for my skin around my eyes either.",9

GREAT TEXTURE, SLIGHTLY TINTED BUT DO NOT RELIEVE PUFFINESS",3.0,"After trying a sample, I bought a full size as I thought it was more effective than it really is to reduce puffiness. It does not help at all. What I like is that it is slightly tinted and has a great texture.",2

Make no mistake: this is a cosmetic concealer, not a dark circle treatment",3.0,"I can see where people think this is an eye treatment, and I guess it is, a bit. This is way more of a concealer; it's pigmented and has some pearlized material to deflect light (and get rid of the appearance of dark circles.) Although La Roche-Posay as a company has the reputation for a strong science component to their products, they are also a cosmetic company, and that's pretty much what this product is - a cosmetic.It does contain caffeine, which has a diuretic effect to relieve puffiness. It also boasts something called Phe-Resorcinol, which I guess is their own proprietary compound. Resorcinol itself is an ingredient in argan oil. The company states that its own blend is ""known for its targeted action on melanin"", making it sound like this is some kind of skin whitener - all products that claim 'brightening' qualities are really talking about lightening.Puffiness can cast a shadow, which can cause the appearance of dark circles. This particular product has a metal applicator. I gather the point of that, in using it to spread the concealer around, is that the cold metal will make the puffiness go away. You can get the same effect by putting a metal teaspoon in the fridge or in a glass of ice water, then using the back of the spoon to press down the puffiness (also watch salt intake, which causes water retention and adds to the puffiness.)You might think caffeine would work on dark circles, but that would depend upon the cause of the circles. Some are hereditary, others can be lifestyle related (tiredness), or can come from age. If your circles have a brownish tinge, use an apricot colored pigment to counter it (this can be in a concealer or just put on the skin, then use a concealer); if your circles have a blue cast, try a yellowish concealer.This particular product is fine as a concealer, but make no mistake. This is much less of a treatment than it is a cosmetic to hide, not cure, dark circles. Short of surgery and injections, nothing permanently gets rid of dark circles. But a good concealer, and knowing how to use it, isn't a bad second choice.",44

Good concealer and under eye cream.  Not an under eye circle cure",3.0,"This is a great under eye concealer for those who are on the lighter end of the skin tone spectrum.  It helps reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eye, and helps improve the texture of the skin.I have been using this twice a day for two weeks.  My dark circles are purplish in color, and hereditary (thanks, Mom!).  They are not terribly obvious since my glasses hid much of the marks, except with winter pale skin.  And winter is coming.  So, when offered the chance to try this product, I decided to get it.The cream is a pale, creamy light beige color, and goes on smoothly with the applicator.  After application, you blend it into the skin with the fingertips.  If your skin is darker or particularly pale in tone, it may take a little more blending so the cream is not noticeable.  I have to blend more than my daughter does (she's really pale).  It does cover the circles, but, as others have remarked, it does not fade them or make them go away.  I have noticed an improvement in the texture of the skin under and around my eyes.  It is smoother and less crepey looking.",11

Okay",3.0,"I'm not quite sure what to make of this. On the one hand I like putting it on and it does seem to de-puff and soften my dark circles. On the other hand, I don't think it's the serum itself but rather the slight tinge of color and the cool metal head, because at the end of the day after I wash my face, I see little or no difference. Still, in the morning and throughout the day it does help make the skin under my eyes look and feel better, so I'll keep using it and see if the serum part of it really works eventually.",4

More of a concealer than healer",3.0,"La Roche-Posay is a trusted name in skin care that I first came across, actually, when I was in Paris in 1997.  I bought a bunch of it and brought it home.  Now, of course, the internet does that for us and this brand is much more widely available.  That's why I jumped at trying the dark circle cream.  Too many nights staying up late working and not enough sleep will give me dark circles.  I was hoping this would be more of a soothing cream to help staver the puffiness off, but it's really more of a concealer than anything.  I liked the coolness of the product when it rolled out from the metal ball, but it wasn't a protective cream as much as something to cover up what was already there.  I used the product for a couple of weeks and really didn't see any change in my skin tone.  That being said, it did well to cover the discoloration and wasn't heavy at all.  Not sure I'd purchase it again, rather look at other products from the La Roche-Posay line.",0

La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Dark Circle Eye",3.0,So how long does this take to work??  I have been using for a week and see no difference in my dark circles...the blue or brown.  I do like the metal applicator that dispenses just the pea-sized amount recommended for each application.  I also like the no fragrance of the product...I just want to know when does it work??  How long do I use this to see results??  Does it take one whole tube or two tubes  or what??  I did not expect a miracle overnight but did think  I would see something in a week.  I will revisit this review with an update when/if I see results.  My dark circle cream came from Amazon and will return for more should this give me the desired results.,0
