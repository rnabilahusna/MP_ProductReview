It works! Amazing product!",5.0,"I could see a difference within a few days. I had just a little under eye puffiness and it’s minimized, and under my eyes look brighter. LaRoche Posay makes a great sunscreen, and I hadn’t tried any of their skin products until now. I’m trying some other skin products of theirs now. The proof is under and around the eyes. I look more refreshed and product goes on cool and light. Highly recommend this!",2

Move over, sandman; my Dark Circles Eye Cream just turned my eyes into the celebrities of the face. Concealing circles and revealing a newfound zest for life – it's the ultimate eye-opener!",11

I like this cream!",5.0,I use this nightly on a clean face before bedtime.  It goes on easily and doesn't have a scent.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate at all.  I notice a difference in the puffiness and circles under my eyes.  The tube lasts awhile so it's worth the price.,9

It actually works",5.0,"I've been self conscious of my under-eye circles since 7th grade, and after using this product for a couple months, I still have under-eye circles, but they have definitely lightened significantly. I also had what i think was a 'milium' under my eye (just Googled the term for this review) that disappeared a few weeks after starting to use this product, though I don't know for sure if this product was what helped (this was the only addition to my skincare routine though). I use it every day and night - after serum, before moisturizer. It's been 4 months and I still have maybe 1/4 of it left. Highly recommend for anyone with dark under-eye circles.",30

I actually like this under eye cream",5.0,"I have been using the under eye cream for about 2 months. I think my under eyes looks so much better. Younger. Less puffy. Dark circles diminished. I went off vacation and forgot to pack it. After just 2 days of not using it my eyes look old again. I can’t believe it. My tip, use in the morning and before bed and NEVER forget to pack it for vacation.It really works. I still can’t believe it.",2

Delighted! Both Helps Hide Dark Circles And Treats the Skin",5.0,"This review comes from the female side of the family. The French company La Roche-Posay is a familiar and respected name to me but I hadn't run across their products for some time. Then I got the chance to review a tube of this eye dark-circle treatment called ""Pigmentclar"" and jumped at it. I don't use a lot of makeup, but I do suffer from dark circles under the eyes, so I always apply something before I go out.I have been using the Pigmentclar product daily for a month and I am  impressed. Let me say first that I'm hard to please with makeup or anything that goes near my eyes! If it stings at all, out it goes. It helps that this eye treatment is hypoallergenic, and free of paraben, alcohol and fragrance. Like some other reviewers, I've suffered from allergies all my life and this seems to go with dark circles. I also want to say that I am light skinned, so my circles just look like a kind of bruising -- not perhaps the very dark circles some of you ladies of darker skin may have. I don't know if or how this would work for you. For me, this product is just right.I've long used cosmetic dark circle concealer, but I have to say, some of it looks artificial, a heavy cover up that is obvious. I don't like that. What's great about this product is that, while it does have pigment in it (mostly zinc oxide like you get in sunblock), it is mostly light and translucent. It is a little ""opalescent"" -- part of how it conceals is that it reflects light. It does have finely ground mica in it, so maybe that is why.The end result is that I get the degree of lightening under the eyes I like, without it looking like it's painted on. This is a cosmetic, but it is also a skin treatment, given the ingredients. So while it does help you cover, it is also treating fine and tender skin with a number of good ingredients. The company tells us the water is from a spring that has a lot of selenium in it, known to help heal eczema and other dermatological problems.You dot the product around the eyes with the cooling metal applicator tip. You could smooth it with that tip as well, but to tell the truth, I find I use too much when I apply it that way. I prefer to dispense a little on a fingertip, and then dab it on.I trust this product to be safe for my skin. I looked up most of the ingredients and discovered that they are ruled safe in Europe as well as the States. In fact, I'm so impressed with La Roche-Posay that I'm going to try their anti-aging line as well. I looked up their website and signed up for the newsletter (and there's no way I'm saying that just for the price of a tube of eye treatment!).I'm delighted to have renewed my acquaintance with the company, and that their products are as good as I remember.Recommended!",3

Dark circle invisibility",5.0,"I have come to the sobering realization that when it comes to removal of under eye circles, there is no magic Bullitt. I’ve lost count looooong ago on how many different creams and or treatments I have tried to banish the raccoon eyes once and for all, and truth be told my circles are still with me.My darkish circles are the product genetics and adult allergies for which there is no scientific treatment to make them go away. So when I came across this eye cream I decided to stop hiding my head in the sand (metaphorically speaking) to see how well the eye cream works.La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Dark Circle Eye Cream is like a Harry Potter cloak of invisibility for your eyes. It reflects light thereby diminishing the appearance of tired and dark appearing circles. The Metal cooling applicator is a nice feature that reduces puffiness upon contact while dispensing pea sized droplets of cream around the eye. Within minutes of smoothing the cream into my lower and upper eyelids my eyes were noticeably brighter and less tired looking. No redness or negative side effects have sprung up during my use, which for me is great given how sensitive my skin can be.I realize that this cream is purely cosmetic, however if it works like it claims to (and it does) I’m sold. Putting my best face forward is going to be a little expensive, and around $43 (currently priced on Amazon) having brighter eyes is well worth the price of admission.",3

It works for me",5.0,"I have purple bruise-like discoloring around my eyes due to a health condition. This made my eyes look much brighter without using actual makeup, which I don’t typically wear. I don’t use this product every day because it’s rather expensive by my standards.",0

Blends nicely, easy to apply makeup over",5.0,"I love the La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Dark Circle Eye Cream so far because it's thick and easily absorbed. You need just a bit and it blends in quite well. It doesn't leave a slick residue on my top lids like my other eye cream. I'm glad because it's easier to apply eye shadow over this product.I have some sun spots near my eyes--since eye creams don't come with spf!--that I'd like to lighten. I'm hoping the ingredient Phe-Resorcinol in this product will help with these spots since they're touted with lightening melanin. I'll update as I use this more. In the meantime, it blends in easily and feels smooth and well-absorbed.The one thing I don't care for is the chrome tip (as seen in the photo) that you are supposed to use to dab the cream on your eye. It's ice cold and entirely unpleasant for me. I just use my finger.My guess is that the Phe-Resorcinol takes more than a week to begin lightening. I have another product I used for Melasma, and that took about a month to see marked differences. I was doing a study for skin cream, and the photographers couldn't believe the differences from the month before. So I'll give this a month.",0

First, it's a great size for travel or to keep in your gym bag or if you are a woman, your purse. The tint is pretty light so you don't look like you are wearing makeup when you put it on, it does help reducing darkness. I am not sure the applicator is amazing so I used my finger to massage the product onto the skin.",0
