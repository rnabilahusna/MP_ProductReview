Worked… with some defects",4.0,"I definitely noticed my under eyes were brighter. After a while though I noticed after washing off the eye cream in the morning, it wouldn’t work well with my concealer and it would become patchy. After a while I also noticed that it left my eyes dry and my circles got darker from constantly rubbing.",26

Okay if you can stand the film.",4.0,"Love the way it moisturizes the eye area; however, it leave behind a layer that peel and rolls if concealer, powder or base is applied even if it is allowed to dry upon application.",24

The applicator just smears it around and I don't want to waste it since it is expensive",4.0,I have noticed my dark circles have diminished but sometimes the product does come out too fast and I have to rub in with my fingers. The applicator just smears it around and I don't want to waste it since it is expensive. I usually just squeeze a small amount on and apply it.,4

Recommend this Product & The Ordinary Caffeine 5% duo for Dark Circles",4.0,"Highly recommend this product! As a Black woman and having severe allergy issues, I've rubbed deep discolorations to my under eye area. If you can envision looking like a raccoon by the eyes, getting black eyes, rubbing your eyes and not getting enough sleep would look like, that is exactly how my dark circles look. They're a deep, dark brown under my eyes.I use this product in conjunction with The Ordinary Caffeine 5% and cannot determine which product is working better, but together, I definitely see results. I'm extremely happy with the results and I'm noticing results expeditiously.  Began using the La-Roche Friday night, 08/07/20 and The Ordinary on Sunday night, 08/09/20 and I've noticed dramatic improvements.I read Caffeine helps restrict the capillaries under the eyes to keep blood from pooling in the area, so I looked specifically for products containing Caffeine. Decided to team up both products and couldn't be happier. Next, I'm adding Derma E's Vitamin C Bright Eyes Hydro Gel Pads to my under eye routine to see if that makes any additional improvements. I'll update this review with pictures in about a week.",3

Very nice product",4.0,"So far, I really like this product.  I've been using it morning and night and my skin feels great!  I have extremely sensitive skin, so I am always wary when it comes to trying new products but I've had good success with this one.  There is not an over bearing scent to it, which is great.  There is a slight tint to the cream and it blends beautifully into my skin.  It doesn't lay on top either, it literally blends beautifully and then is absorbed without any greasy or caky after effect.The applicator is really smooth and contoured to fit the eye very well.  It is designed to give you some circulation while you apply it which is TERRIFIC for puffy eyes.Over all I am extremely pleased with the product, although I haven't noticed any significant changes under the eye with regard to my dark circles, I have noticed that my skin feels really good and I do like the brightening effect it has on my overall skin appearance.I will continue using for a few more weeks and post any updates with regard to improvement.",0

Noticeable improvement after two weeks",4.0,"I've tried many brands of dark circle correctors and had given up finding one that would work. Most left a filmy or tacky look that was worse than the dark circles.The La Roche-Posay system is different. It combines a quality concealer with gentle eye massage to move the fluid and puffiness away from under the eyes.The concealer blends cleanly, absorbs quickly, and didn't leave a trace. It noticeably brightened my skin. It's fragrance-free and non-irritating. I wear contact lenses and this did not bother my eyes at all, even when I got a little too close and some got in my eye.Using the metal applicator to apply the cream worked well, but I found it a little awkward for the massage and ended up using my fingers to gently massage out from the inside of my eye.After using the cream and eye massage twice a day, morning and evening, I definitely see a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.",3

Brightens Eyes",4.0,"The La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Dark Eye Circle Cream does work to lighten up dark areas around the eyes. This has a metal tipped applicator that I really like, the cream feels good going on with the cool metal tip. I thought at first that this product was a dark circle treatment but the more I used it the more I realized this is a treatment for under make-up or when you want circles lightened up such as from a bad night's sleep. This is a light colored cream and a little bit goes a long way. The directions say to use it with the applicator above and below the eye area, and rub with the tip until it's absorbed. This is a long lasting tube that does provide results. This isn't a treatment however, but more of a cosmetic type product. You could probably get the same results using a concealer that you do with this product, although, I find this cream unique with its light color and metal applicator. This is an interesting product that does lighten under eye circles pretty well.",5

Good for Puffiness but Not for Circles",4.0,"I've reviewed almost a dozen ""Dark Eye Circle"" products on Amazon. I've had blue-ish circles for many years and probably more noticeable in the past 10. I have very translucent skin, so the pigment shows up pretty well. In my case, it's all genentic. So, I decided to try this and see what happened.I tested this for 3 weeks, following the directions of applying 2 times daily. This is a very nice cream, no scent and goes on cool because of the applicator. It did reduce the puffiness around my eyes. It did NOT change the color of the circles. During the day, it does act as a bit of a cover, although I still use Benefit's ""Boing"" to also conceal. The cream makes the Boing a bit smoother so it doesn't settle in the small wrinkles, giving me a more even look.I wish it did take away the bluish tint but alas, it did not.. I liked but did not love this product and for the price, I'm not sure I'd buy it regularly.",0

My dark circles are less visible",4.0,"I've used plenty of eye creams for wrinkles, for eye shadow priming, for skin softening...but I've never used one to get rid of dark circles.  I've just always used concealer for that.  I have no idea whether I have blue or brown dark circles or both, but this cream has noticeably brightened the area around my eyes in about 5 days.  I'm an early to bed and early to rise girl, so I don't have ""party into the wee hours of the morning"" types of dark circles around my eyes, so the dark circles I battle may not be the same as the ones you fight.  One thing I can say about this product is I am blown away by the cooling applicator!  At first I thought ""this is just a tapered applicator for dispensing the product"".  Then, when I used it, I couldn't believe how cooling and soothing it actually was.",0

so far so good but I need more time for evaluation",4.0,"I gave this product to my wife and here’s what she had to say: The metal applicator seems a little silly at first (why not use your finger?) but it does feel kinda good and I guess it doesn't tug on the skin like your finger might. The cream seems to have a little tint to it, so it provides an immediate cosmetic effect to lighten the under eye area. And after application, I have noticed a subtle tingling feeling, which makes me feel like it is working, or doing something.  I haven't really noticed any permanent changes yet, but I'll give it a little more time since I’ve only been using it a few weeks. So far so good though.",2

A great temporary fix",4.0,"This is really easy to apply, and seems to perk up my eyes before my makeup goes on. I like the way that it feels but I wouldn't say it will leave permanent results. This is a great temporary fix for dark circles, and can help to make your face look brighter and more refreshed. I absolutely plan to continue using this as part of my daily beauty regime. It will last about 2 months of daily use before I will need to buy more. There is almost no scent to the product which is really nice.",0

Excellent cover cream",4.0,"This is a very nice under-eye concealer cream.  It goes on easily, and covers well.  In fact it does a better job than anything else I have used and lasts all day.  Another majorr plus is the fact that it is unscented; fragrance is the last thing I want near my eyes.  It is pricey, though you need very little, so I expect it to last a while.  As far as I can tell, it just comes in one shade, which suitw my skin well, but a variety of shades would be nice, as women are not all one color (minus a star for that).",0

Good concealer",4.0,"It's a nice concealer, but I find it a little shinier than I'm used to. It blends well, and while I see the point of the metal applicator, I don't like it. It's uncomfortable enough I stopped using it. It reduces circles under the eyes as any good concealer should, and does it somewhat better than most.",0
