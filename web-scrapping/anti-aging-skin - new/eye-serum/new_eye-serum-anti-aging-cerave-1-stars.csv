Horrible!",1.0,"If I could give this product a zero stars I would. It has caused a severe allergic reaction under my eyes they are very swollen, and burning. It also looks as if it has made my fine lines worse! I have used this product for maybe a month and  I had no reaction at first but now that have used it consistently I guess I developed one.  Now when I use it my eyes swell, burn, and itch horribly! It says it is hypoallergenic but it most certainly is not!",0

SUPER Drying and Irritating!!",1.0,"I thought I would give this a try based on reviews & because I use Cerave face wash & moisturizing lotion & cream. Also, to take a break from my normal $50-$60 eye creams. This was EXTREMELY drying to under both eyes, made the skin pink & burned really bad under the eyes. Tried using it x4 times & experienced the exact same reaction each time! Definitely NOT good for aging skin, dry skin, sensitive skin, or anyone using Tretinoin or Retinol creams. Beware!!!",0

Useless!",1.0,This is a gel like consistency. It goes on smoothly but within a half hour it has disappeared!! Not in any way smoothing or moisturizing. I am in my mid 60â€™s and have used high end quality skin care for years but at a cost. Tried this to save money!! Donâ€™t bother! You get what you pay for!,0

Itchy",1.0,"Iâ€™ve been using it religiously since it arrived. So Iâ€™ve been using it for about a month. I havenâ€™t had any noticeable differences other than how itchy my eyes are after use. So this product does not agree with me even if it might for others. I do not normally have sensitive skin either and can usually use all sorts of products. It definitely seems like it moisturizes and doesnâ€™t have a heavy scent, which is nice around a sensitive area like the eyes. Maybe I got a bad batch, idk. But Iâ€™m not going to purchase again.",3

Selling returned items?",1.0,"I can't rate the product because I have not used it.  I purchased a tube & when I received it the box was crushed & only had the tube of cream in it...no insert, etc.  So the tube was open as was the box.  I am used to buying creams that arrive sealed.I received a replacement tube yesterday.  It appears to have been used, also.  It is in the same condition as the item mentioned above.  Plus, there  was a plastic wrap around the box, at one point.  Most of the wrap has been removed except for part of it.I find it difficult to believe this is a new product, in original packaging, etc.  I am not going to try to return it because the box store is not close to my home & it is difficult to get to.",6

Shipped from another country",1.0,I ordered this item when it was on sale through Prime on Jan 4. It finally arrived today Jan 24 & the tracking originated from another country.

Stings!",1.0,I thought I would give this product a fair shot seeing as I like other products by CeraVe. I am very disappointed to report this eye cream burns like fires of mount doom. I could also swear I now have more fine lines under my eyes since beginning this product. What gives?!,2

Not sure how this got 4.5 stars!",1.0,I used this morning and night exactly as directed and I noticed the fine lines and fine wrinkles get worse! I went back to my old eye cream. I'm 41 and to notice wrinkles and lines get worse in a 2 week or more period is concerning. As soon as I switched back to my original product I immediately started to notice a difference. This was just my personal experience. I understand everyone has different skin and different effects. But I honestly would not recommend it. I like other crave products but this was a big disappointment. ðŸ˜•,6

Burned my skin",1.0,This really burned my skin to the point that I was getting red welts under my eyes.

I returned this after only a couple weeks of using it. I would just be cautious,2

Allergic reaction",1.0,"Not sure what is in this product to have caused such a significant allergic reaction, as I have never reacted to anything except nickel in jewelry. The first time it was mild, and I didnâ€™t know it was from this product. The second time it was much worse. It took a very long time to heal with alot of steroids. My colleague also had to stop using it because she was having a reaction as well. She said sheâ€™s been using cerave for years without issue but started getting a rash under her eyes for a few weeks, unknown why until she stopped using this product and it went away. Iâ€™ve also found multiple stories online regarding reactions to it. Clearly thereâ€™s something else in this product that isnâ€™t natural. I am pretty disappointed as I am a PA and it makes me sad that unsafe products are being sold but marketed as safe.",6

Causes more wrinkles",1.0,"So I bought this product at Walmart and have been using it as directed for the past 2 weeks. Iâ€™m 22 but I have fine lines under my eyes along with a lot of texture, and I tried this out to basically get ahead and prevent more wrinkles essentially. Unfortunately, within a week I noticed that the lines I already had are worse and I even have more lines now. I didnâ€™t have crows feet before but now I do. Iâ€™m  super disappointed and sad because I take a lot of pride in my appearance and Iâ€™m upset that I got this cream to prevent this and all it did was make it worse. Hopefully when I find something else itâ€™ll fix it. Iâ€™m just sad because now I look like I aged myself :(",0

Teared up after using",1.0,I use several CeraVe products but the eye cream is one I can't. Within  an hour of applying my eyes started to burn and tear up and become photo sensitive.  Only applied to the  lower eye area.  This is just a headsup if you have sensitive eyes.,2
