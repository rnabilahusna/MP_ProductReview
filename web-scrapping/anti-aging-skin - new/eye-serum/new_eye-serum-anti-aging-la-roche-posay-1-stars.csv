Product out of box",1.0,"When I opened the box, the eye cream was out of its box and the container was opened and really messed up. I'm nervous to use the product because it wasn't in the box. As seen in the photo, the box was laying right next to the cream.  How does that happen!? I'm not sure what to do...I was really excited about the product...",0

Does not get absorbed well. Yellow smears under the eyes after hours of application",1.0,"So after I applied this cream under the eyes per its instructions, few hours after I was “ complemented” and questioned why there is something under my eyes. I found yellowish patches ( sort of sour cream gets dried color) under my eyes. So it doesn’t absorb well. And having that metal prob on the tip of tube doesn’t make any difference. Poor quality I think for this price.",0

Didn’t work for me",1.0,This product irritated my eyes. The product itself leaves a residue that looks flakey. It does make your dark circles look lighter because it’s a tinted product. Just not what I’d hoped for. It’s going back.,2

not worth it at all",1.0,Never been so disappointed in an eye cream before and I've tried a lot due to my dark circles. Don't waste your money on this product. Its only like white paint and doesn't actually target the skins complexion. But what made me hate it the most is that it dries and starts peeling leaving your very dull,5
