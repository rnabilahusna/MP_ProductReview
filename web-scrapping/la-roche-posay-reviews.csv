Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book! I can't wait to try their Vitamin C serum!"

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

Miracle for my combo skin",08/11/2023,"My dermatologist recommended me this for my combination skin. My cheeks are always so dry. Let me tell you, this was a GAME-CHANGER! It does such an amazing job keeping my face hydrated. I feel like I’m always changing lotions and serums looking for something, but I finally found it! I will continue to buy this over and over again.It’s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it’s definitely worth it."

It's fine",04/11/2023,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues. HOWEVER, there are other brands that do just as well that cost less than $15 so I'm just not understanding the hype."

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

It's fine",04/11/2023,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues. HOWEVER, there are other brands that do just as well that cost less than $15 so I'm just not understanding the hype."

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book!

I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book! I can't wait to try their Vitamin C serum!"

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book!

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

It does such an amazing job keeping my face hydrated. I feel like I’m always changing lotions and serums looking for something, but I finally found it! I will continue to buy this over and over again.It’s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it’s definitely worth it."

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

It's fine",04/11/2023,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book!

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book! I can't wait to try their Vitamin C serum!"

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

It does such an amazing job keeping my face hydrated. I feel like I’m always changing lotions and serums looking for something, but I finally found it! I will continue to buy this over and over again.It’s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it’s definitely worth it."

It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

It's fine",04/11/2023,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book!

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book! I can't wait to try their Vitamin C serum!"

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

It does such an amazing job keeping my face hydrated. I feel like I’m always changing lotions and serums looking for something, but I finally found it! I will continue to buy this over and over again.It’s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it’s definitely worth it."

It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

It's fine",04/11/2023,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

Does really good job of hydrating skin.",01/12/2023,I've tried many skin moisturizing products. My face has several areas that get dry and burn or itch. Not sure if it is rosacia(sp) or not. This product really does hydrate very well. My red spots calm down and stop burning and itching within minutes of using this. So for my sensitive skin issues this works well. Not so sure about removing lines but that was not my concern. It does feel sticky and tacky when you first put it on. It's fine after it dries and absorbs into your skin. The fragance I could do without and that's why I downgraded my review. Make it fragrance free and I would say 5 stars.

BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum",02/11/2023,"I have tried different brands that were expensive but not as good as their priced claimed, which is why i was hesitant to try this one. But I bite the bullet and bought this anyways; I have only tried this for almost 2wks, but i have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL I can't say yet if it is working as it promised, but my skin isn't reacting bad so that is a WIN in my book! I can't wait to try their Vitamin C serum!"

Next best hyaluronic acid serum to skinceuticals",01/11/2023,"I'm a guy and have tried a bunch of hyaluronic acid serums with no luck. This one gives me a natural brigtness/glow to my complexion. I had initially tried skinceuticals one since it was thinner and more absorving and this one was a little thicker. But I have found that during the winter now this one, thicker, works better for me.You have to put it on top of damp skin, so I use the La roche posay thermal water mist and then this and then I use a moisturizer on top."

Miracle for my combo skin",08/11/2023,"My dermatologist recommended me this for my combination skin. My cheeks are always so dry. Let me tell you, this was a GAME-CHANGER! It does such an amazing job keeping my face hydrated. I feel like I’m always changing lotions and serums looking for something, but I finally found it! I will continue to buy this over and over again.It’s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it’s definitely worth it."

It's fine",04/11/2023,"Purchased only because the price was temporarly reduced and I had heard of the brand but I don't see the value. It does exactly as intended and I have no signs of irritation, it's fine and no issues. HOWEVER, there are other brands that do just as well that cost less than $15 so I'm just not understanding the hype."
