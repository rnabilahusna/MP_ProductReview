1,"this is just me writing of my personal experience with the product.first off, i will say that i am not a female, but a thirty-something y.o. male with sensitive skin who has been dealing with acne since my teen years. and i've recently been struggling with a pretty bad breakout which is why i decided to buy this product when it went on sale.now, that being said, i cannot understand how this is the bestselling facial cleanser on amazon.but anyway... i'll just list my problems with the product.1. the product does not lather at all, it's more of a cream cleanser, so if you have acne-riddled skin like me, you probably do not want to be rubbing something all over your face; i lightly pat my face with lather when i wash, i do not rub, and this product makes it very difficult to do that.* maybe if you're a female it would be good to remove makeup, i don't know, i'm just guessing about that, the creamy consistency and ingredients lead me to think it would, but for me, it serves no purpose as i cannot actually use it to wash my face.2. it irritates my skin. i've used it three times, and each time it has burned, it's only a slight sting, but it's there.3. because of these issues and my desire to not have to return the product, i have tried mixing a small amount of this cerave cleanser with a bit of another soap/body wash, i use olay and/or dial, hoping it would add the beneficial properties while the soap would ameliorate the negatives, namely, not lathering and being slightly irritating, but unfortunately, the cerave seems to basically dissolve the soap and makes the entire mixture extremely thin, with a consistency barely greater than water, so i cannot really use it for anything.all i can say is, i really wanted to like this product, thought i would based on all the positive reviews and the reputation of the company along with their product pricing, but unfortunately, it doesn't work for me and i'll have to send it back.oh, and i give one star for scent because there is no scent, and while some people may think that's a good thing, i like my bath products to have a light/moderate scent.does not work for me. bought because it's non-foaming, but it doesn't lather, & it irritates my skin",CeraVe,"['writing', 'personal', 'experience', 'product first', 'not', 'female', 'thirtysomething', 'y o', 'male', 'dealing', 'teen', 'struggling', 'pretty', 'bad', 'breakout', 'decided', 'sale now', 'not', 'understand', 'bestselling', 'amazon but', 'list', 'not', 'lather', 'acneriddled', 'not', 'rubbing', 'lightly', 'pat', 'lather', 'not', 'difficult', 'female', 'remove', 'nt', 'guessing', 'creamy', 'consistency', 'ingredients', 'lead', 'serves', 'purpose', 'not', 'face ', 'irritates', 'times', 'burned', 'slight', 'sting', 'there ', 'issues', 'desire', 'not', 'return', 'mixing', 'soapbody', 'olay', 'andor', 'dial', 'hoping', 'add', 'beneficial', 'properties', 'soap', 'ameliorate', 'negatives', 'not', 'lathering', 'irritating', 'basically', 'dissolve', 'soap', 'entire', 'mixture', 'extremely', 'consistency', 'barely', 'water', 'not', 'anything all', 'based', 'positive', 'reviews', 'reputation', 'company', 'pricing', 'nt', 'send', 'back oh', 'star', 'bath', 'products', 'lightmoderate', 'scent does', 'not', 'nonfoaming', 'nt', 'lather', 'irritates']",writing personal experience product first not female thirtysomething y o male dealing teen struggling pretty bad breakout decided sale now not understand bestselling amazon but list not lather acneriddled not rubbing lightly pat lather not difficult female remove nt guessing creamy consistency ingredient lead serf purpose not face  irritates time burned slight sting there  issue desire not return mixing soapbody olay andor dial hoping add beneficial property soap ameliorate negative not lathering irritating basically dissolve soap entire mixture extremely consistency barely water not anything all based positive review reputation company pricing nt send back oh star bath product lightmoderate scent does not nonfoaming nt lather irritates,0.9652,positive
