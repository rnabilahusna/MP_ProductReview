4,"truly gentle on the skin.i have combination oily and dry skin, and a lot of other cleansers make my skin really, really dry. i needed something that didn't take all the moisture out of my skin. a lot of gentle cleansers don't give me that foaming effect that i like so i thought i would try cerave.i was a little hesitant at first because of all the negative reviews and horror pictures that i saw, but i'm glad i did. my skin hasn't had any bad breakouts or irritation at all. in fact, i think my skin has improved. normally after washing my face it would feel so dry and i would have to moisturize immediately, but sometimes my face feels so supple and soft that i forget.so downside? the cleanser comes out a clear liquid and it ""foams"" but doesn't get very foamy. it gets more soapy than anything. i wouldn't call it foam. i really miss that bubbling/foaming action that other cleansers have because i feel much cleaner, but this is just okay. another downside is that i have to do two washes to really get all the makeup/oil/dirt off. this cleanser is really gentle so it doesn't pull all of the impurities off your skin, which is also why i think my skin feels so much more moisturized than it did before. i don't mind it and have gotten used to it.all skin types are different so while some break out and have bad reactions, others may not. my skin honestly feels so much healthier now than it did before. i now subscribe and save to this cleanser because it has been working so well for me. it's not expensive so i would recommend anyone to give it a shot. worst case if it doesn't work with your face, use it to wash your hands.a lot of gentle cleansers don't give me that foaming effect that i like so i thought i would try cerave",CeraVe,"['gentle', 'skin i', 'combination', 'cleansers', 'nt', 'gentle', 'cleansers', 'nt', 'cerave i', 'hesitant', 'negative', 'reviews', 'horror', 'pictures', 'glad', 'nt', 'bad', 'breakouts', 'irritation', 'improved', 'washing', 'feels', 'supple', 'soft', 'forget so', 'downside', 'liquid', 'foams', 'nt', 'foamy', 'soapy', 'nt', 'bubblingfoaming', 'action', 'cleansers', 'cleaner', 'downside', 'washes', 'makeupoildirt', 'gentle', 'nt', 'pull', 'impurities', 'feels', 'nt', 'mind', 'it all', 'types', 'break', 'bad', 'reactions', 'not', 'feels', 'healthier', 'subscribe', 'save', 'not', 'expensive', 'recommend', 'shot', 'worst', 'nt', 'hands a', 'gentle', 'cleansers', 'nt']",gentle skin i combination cleanser nt gentle cleanser nt cerave i hesitant negative review horror picture glad nt bad breakout irritation improved washing feel supple soft forget so downside liquid foam nt foamy soapy nt bubblingfoaming action cleanser cleaner downside wash makeupoildirt gentle nt pull impurity feel nt mind it all type break bad reaction not feel healthier subscribe save not expensive recommend shot worst nt hands a gentle cleanser nt,-0.8871,negative

5,"**************************pro tip****************************i took the advice of another reviewer and cut off the bottom of the tube to see if i could get any more out, and sure enough, there was a treasure trove of extra moisturizer at the top near the opening that will last you another week at the minimum. when you reach the end of your bottle, definitely cut it open, because this stuff is expensive. i was able to carefully wrap the tube up and store it in a plastic baggie with all the air squeezed out. in total, this tiny bottle lasted from the beginning of august until mid-october for me.********************************************************review:previously, i've never in my 23 years of life ever been able to have clear skin (other than before puberty). i've always had acne. i always took great care of my face (washed twice a day, avoided touching it), but nothing ever worked. all of the other things on the market (even the supposed #1 dermatologist recommended) never did anything for me; none of the dermatological-prescribed creams, pills, or face washes could ever touch me. i have combination skin: oily/greasy city in some places, and dry as the sahara in others. if you have it too, you have my sincere condolences, because i think that up to this point in my review, we have had the same experience.until this brand. unlike other moisturizers, it's not heavy. it doesn't feel like it's cake. it's light and my skin breathes. it moisturizes the dry spots and doesn't irritate or inflame the acne-prone oily spots. i live in texas - aka sweaty city - and i swear, this stuff still doesn't feel like it's heavy on my face, even when it's 105 out. i've never moisturized before because of my acne and my stupid combination skin, but after buying this, i can see that it's possible. you get what you pay for with this stuff.now, price-wise, it is a little much. and the bottle is laughably small. but like other reviewers mentioned, a little bit really goes a long way. i do a tiny pea-sized dab for each cheek (which you can push to cover your nose and chin/upper lip) and another for my forehead and that's worked well for me. it spreads very, very easily. the smell doesn't bother me; other reviews mentioned a chemical smell, but i wouldn't really put it like that. it just smells like cream.i wish i'd had this stuff at 14. maybe my life would've been different. do yourself a favor and buy this. you will not be sorry.**edit**i wanted to come and edit this review to specifically mention the importance of using this moisturizer in combination with the face wash. the face wash i bought along with this is la rochay effaclar purifying gel. i am always so instinctively skeptical and wary about using anything that claims to ""moisturize"" my face, so after about 2 months i stopped applying this moisturizer after every wash and started only doing it a few times a week - bad, bad, bad idea. my face in turn began producing oils to compensate for the drying effects of my face wash. after all, the face wash is more on the acidic side. after trial and error, i'm here to tell you that yes, you need to use this stuff every time you wash your face. it doesn't make me break out whatsoever unless i skip one of these two products. do not skip this important step!

4,"if your skin is too sensitive for retinol you should try this. apparently jumping right in using a retinol cream every night was a bad idea. my skin rebelled and i screwed up the moisture barrier. so i put that cream aside, rebalanced my skin by being extra gentle and tried this serum. 1 my skin is sensitive, 2 my skin is normally on the drier side. 3 i occasionally get pimples along my jaw line during my period.when i was half way through this bottle i noticed my pores looked more clear and less clogged which gave them the appearance of being smaller, which they don't get smaller just less noticable. i suffer from massively clogged pores specifically on my nose. they always looked dirty. they were less so now. i didn't experience any dryness or irritation. if you do i suggest using a hyaluronic acid serum before this one and giving it time to soak in. i've done that here and there on drier skin days. by the end of the bottle i noticed some unevenness in skin texture was smoothing out and darker scars from acne were ever so slightly lightening up.i have a bad habit of not giving products enough time to work and moving on bc i want instant results, yeah not smart. because this is a much gentler form of retinol it will take longer to see full results but i've already started using my second bottle and that wonderful horizontal worry line on my forehead is ever so slowly becoming less noticable.bc of how sensitive my skin is i was afraid i would never be able to use a retinol product bc i've tried many with disastrous results even when i used them once or twice a week.cerave knows how to take care of skin, they know how to create products that work effectively for all skin types without damaging your skin in the process. you just need to figure out what your skin needs and check out their line of products. i didn't notice any particular scent but as far as i know they do not add fragrance to any of their products which i appreciate bc my skin does not like fragrance even if my nose does.when i run out of this product i will be repurchasing and i use this in conjunction with the cerave skin renewing night cream or the original cerave moisturizing cream at night if my skin is particularly dry.my skin, at 33 looks better now than 5 years ago bc i'm making an effort to take care of it. i wish i had back as a teenager but maybe anybody reading this will think about taking care of it better bc it's never too late to start. last thing, i always wear a sunscreen during the day. i'm not a foundation fan but i love the cerave tinted sunscreen. it offers the right tint to even out my complexion while still protecting. it's on the moisturizing side so give it a few minutes to soak in or use a little setting powder and your good to go.also, the tinted sunscreen is not great for darker skin people, i'm pretty pale, so if cerave could expand that line to include a larger range of skin tones that would be so helpful.a

5,"i keep coming back to this unassuming cleanser every time my skin gets the winter blues. for reference:i have oily, combination, with dry patches (overusing tretinoin 0.1) skin and i love heavy skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. so i use embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as i felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault i’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so i started switching to gentler products, taking a page from french skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better. so i randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. i tried it for a few days and i hated it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. so i did with it what i did with other hated products—i put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. but, after a year or so i decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from youtube derms. and i decided to actually give it a try. because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.after trying a few weeks i loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. it would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. my skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like sahara desert. it really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that i know my skin can use during the colder months. i never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. it soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight. the only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, i use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. i usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so i can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. i’m used to it now not lathering and i’m fine with it. you can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. i’m a convert believer!skincare staple for a reason",CeraVe,"['coming',

skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. so i use embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as i felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault i’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so i started switching to gentler products, taking a page from french skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better.i randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. i tried it for a few days and i hated it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. so i did with it what i did with other hated products—i put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. but, after a year or so i decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from youtube derms. and i decided to actually give it a try. because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.after trying a few weeks i loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. it would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. my skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like sahara desert. it really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that i know my skin can use during the colder months. i never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. it soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight.the only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, i use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. i usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so i can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. i’m used to it now not lathering and i’m fine with it. you can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. i’m a convert believer!skincare staple for a reason",CeraVe,"['coming',
