1,"i bought this because i’ve had really oily skin for the summer. my face had finally cleared up after several visits to the dermatologist and using a different cleanser so i decided it couldn’t hurt to try this product since i’ve heard nothing but good things about cerave. first of all, i should’ve known this cleanser would be terrible as soon as i tried it because it smells horrible; it has this awful chemical smell that i knew i shouldn’t have trusted (but i did because i’ve never used any cerave product before). i also wanted to wait a while after using this cleanser to post a review, but it’s only been a month and it has absolutely ruined my face. maybe that’s not long enough time for my face to get used to the product or something but i honestly can’t continue using it after comparing how bad my acne is now to how clear my face was using cheaper products a month ago. maybe it works for some, but this was not the product for me. it also didn’t even help with the oily skin problem lol. it definitely got worse within the month.there’s no way these reviews are serious",CeraVe,"['summer', 'cleared', 'visits', 'decided', 'hurt', 'heard', 'terrible', 'smells', 'horrible', 'awful', 'chemical', 'trusted', 'wait', 'post', 'absolutely', 'ruined', 'not', 'continue', 'comparing', 'bad', 'cheaper', 'products', 'not', 'lol', 'worse', 'month there', 'reviews']",summer cleared visit decided hurt heard terrible smell horrible awful chemical trusted wait post absolutely ruined not continue comparing bad cheaper product not lol worse month there review,-0.8696,negative
1,bought this for my child to use as a face wash to help with small breakout in her t-zone area. it caused an allergic reaction all over her face. she had red irritated patches on her cheeks and jawline and clear lines of demarcation across her face. took her to the doctor to make sure it wasn’t a rash or infectious process of some sort to be extra cautious. after checking her over and then going over anything she was exposed to the doctor was pretty convinced it was the face wash as the culprit. she had to take some antihistamines and some anti inflammatory meds and put hydrocortisone cream on the patches for a few days and simply wash her face with warm water to let it rest and help it heal. i’m sure a lot of people use this product with no issue but i would strongly suggest a skin patch test for a couple of days before using on your entire face.caused reaction- proceed with caution.,CeraVe,"['child', 'breakout', 'tzone', 'caused', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'red', 'irritated', 'patches', 'cheeks', 'jawline', 'lines', 'demarcation', 'doctor', 'rash', 'infectious', 'process', 'sort', 'extra', 'cautious', 'checking', 'exposed', 'doctor', 'pretty', 'convinced', 'culprit', 'antihistamines', 'anti', 'inflammatory', 'meds', 'hydrocortisone', 'patches', 'days', 'simply', 'warm', 'water', 'rest', 'heal', 'patch', 'couple', 'days', 'entire', 'face caused', 'reaction', 'proceed', 'caution']",child breakout tzone caused allergic reaction red irritated patch cheek jawline line demarcation doctor rash infectious process sort extra cautious checking exposed doctor pretty convinced culprit antihistamine anti inflammatory med hydrocortisone patch day simply warm water rest heal patch couple day entire face caused reaction proceed caution,-0.4767,negative

5,"my dermatologist recommended this face wash to me, and i’ve been using it ever since.  i was previously using a face wash with benzoyl peroxide that left my face dried out and constantly needing moisturizer.  after making the switch to this, my skin is a lot less dry and sensitive.this foams up nice and easily, and feels very clean and light on the skin.  there’s no noticeable smell, and overall just feels like you’re barely using anything at all, yet it gets the job done.  you hardly need to use much at all every time, so each bottle lasts a really long time.  i’d highly recommend this.dermatologist recommended face wash",CeraVe,"['recommended', 'benzoyl', 'peroxide', 'left', 'dried', 'constantly', 'switch', 'sensitive this', 'foams', 'nice', 'easily', 'feels', 'clean', 'light', 'noticeable', 'feels', 'barely', 'job', 'lasts', 'highly', 'recommend', 'this dermatologist', 'recommended']",recommended benzoyl peroxide left dried constantly switch sensitive this foam nice easily feel clean light noticeable feel barely job last highly recommend this dermatologist recommended,0.9061,positive
5,"i purchased a 3oz bottle of this from my local store, which lasted a long time by the way. i decided i loved it enough to order the larger value size.i have experimented with different washes for years, different acne remedies for years, and never quite got 100% perfect skin for my trouble. i've spent thousands (no exaggeration) on washes, skincare, treatments, doctors. i've tinkered with yt suggestions, diy potions, all natural, multi-step kits, suggested regimens like 5 or 10 step korean skincare. i've eliminated foods from my diet, attempted to regulate hormones, etc. none of it did much to improve my overall complexion. recently, i started struggling with blackheads and unflattering texture along my jawline alongside my acne and needed to change it up.after watching dr. dray on yt (great dermatologist out of tx who promotes a less is more approach to skincare), i purged everything that had, especially anything with superfluous fragrance and dyes and went back to basics. per her suggestion, i had been using the cerave hydrating cleansers. i have sensitive skin and while i'm oily in places, i've heard hydrating cleansers are ideal overall. the hydrating version did nothing for my oil, the cause of my blackheads. i'm sure it would be fine for someone who has dry skin, but i needed something to cut the oil without over-drying. this foaming version of the same brand's cleanser breaks down the excess oil without overdrying the face and works well as a second step if you do the two-step oil cleansing method (which i do to remove sunscreen and makeup). it's fragrance-free, dye-free, ph balanced, loaded with ceramides, etc..you know the drill. all the good, little to no bad as far as i can tell.ultimately, i've found [for me] i have to wash morning and night. none of this, splashing a little warm water on my face in the morning and you only have to wash once. it is not enough for someone with skin that likes to lean on the oily side. it's just not. under or overwashing can both lead to other issues. so, for me 2x is plenty. i use this fantastic foaming cleanser both times, all over my face. as part of my routine, i use the ordinary's sa 2% (only on the acne prone areas), brush my teeth to give it time to soak in, then apply their niacinamide 10%/zinc serum. the combination of this wash, the sa, and niacinamide has cut my oiliness considerably without drying me out. i don't feel like an oil slick mid-day. still, i top it off with a little of the cerave regular moisturizer, cerave daily moisturizing lotion with hyaluronic acid and ceramides for normal to dry skin. i don't need a lot, but everyone needs moisturizer, & then i have a great water-gel sunscreen. i use a 30 to 50spf daily on my face, neck, chest, and ears.pm - i  double-cleanse the spf and makeup off using this wash as my 2nd step after an oil-based remover, and after i've gently wiped away the excess balm or oil with a fragrance-free baby wipe or tissue. no point in struggling to remove everything with a wash alone. i don't expect any single wash to remove my spf and makeup and i'm pretty minimalist. so if you love smearing copious amounts of foundations, powders, etc. on your face, you really should try to remove as much of it with removers or an oil-cleanse before you try to wash it with this. i use this wash, sa 2% (again only on the acne prone areas), the niacinamide, the cerave moisturizer and i'm done.i've been doing this routine for a few weeks now and the blackheads are disappearing, the hyperpigmentation is vastly improving (fading), no new acne has appeared, and the uneven texture along my jawline is almost gone. the only difference in recent months has been swapping out a hydrating wash for this foaming one for my combo, mature, sensitive skin. i can't say enough good things about it: inexpensive, effective, non-drying, not harsh, etc. i wish i had gone to this sooner, but many of us with serious skin issues are often fooled into thinking we have to pay a fortune and pile on the products in order to get great results. my advice, strip everything to the basics and build from there. i'm so pleased with this wash. i hope they don't do something stupid like reformulate it for some reason. best to leave a great thing alone.hands down best wash ever for combo, acne-prone skin (even mature, sensitive

5,"i never heard of this brand or product before until i saw a manufacturer's coupon in the paper for their effaclar duo acne cream product.  right away, i start to google info about the brand/products.  as always, i also go to amazon.com to read everyone's reviews about any products.  the reviews were promising and thought i would give the cleanser a try.  i used obagi nu derm product line for almost 3 years.  in the past year, i have had many hormonal monthly breakouts every single month.  i started to trying other products that would clean my oily skin better and prevent big acne cystic breakouts.  i've tried other products like peter thomas roth,  and cetaphil oily skin cleanser (that didn't break any oils off my skin), and over the counter products, but they left my skin too dry and i still had blemishes and acne, the kind that are big red and bumpy first like a mosquito bite, then it finally breaks through with the pus. ( i know, it's digesting)so far, i have used this foaming cleanser all week.  the cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, free of the day's mineral makeup products and removes the oily, shiny skin i have very refreshed and cleansed.  my face felt clean, soft and not tight.  i am in my upper 40s and i don't want products that make my skin feel too dry or tight.  this cleanser leaves my skin feeling soothed, clean and fresh.i am also ordering their effaclar mtoner to complement the cleanser and i will slowly build up the effaclar line into my skin routine, including the eye cream.  for someone who has had those cystic, hormonal big red bump pimples, i hope this will be my answer to finally get things under control.  my dermatologist gave me retin a micro to put on my giant pimples.  all the retin a did was dry it up a bit, flake my skin along the surrounding area and then as the pimple dries up, it makes it super dark and leaving me with this very dark pigmented scar.  so, i quit using the retin a too.  i bought the effaclar duo acne treatment because it has peroxide which i hope will lighten up the pimple and its scars.i'll have to update this review after a month or two of using the la roche-posay products.  but so far, i like the way my skin looks and feel.update: feb. 13, 2013:i returned this product as it was overly drying to my oily skin.  it was very effective at drying the oily skin; actually too much for me.  perhaps for a teenager with extreme oily and acne skin types.excellent for oily sensitive acne-prone,  skin",La Roche-Posay,"['heard', 'manufacturer', 'coupon', 'paper', 'effaclar', 'duo', 'start', 'google', 'info', 'brandproducts', 'amazon com', 'read', 'reviews', 'products', 'reviews', 'promising', 'obagi', 'derm', 'monthly', 'breakouts', 'single', 'products', 'clean', 'prevent', 'cystic', 'breakouts', 'products', 'peter', 'thomas', 'roth', 'cetaphil', 'nt', 'break', 'oils', 'counter', 'products', 'left', 'blemishes', 'red', 'bumpy', 'mosquito', 'bite', 'breaks', 'pus', 'digesting', 'leaves', 'clean', 'mineral', 'products', 'removes', 'shiny', 'refreshed', 'cleansed', 'clean', 'soft', 'not', 'tight', 'upper', 'nt', 'products', 'tight', 'leaves', 'soothed', 'clean', 'fresh i', 'effaclar', 'mtoner', 'complement', 'slowly', 'build', 'effaclar', 'including', 'cystic', 'red', 'bump', 'pimples', 'hope', 'answer', 'retin', 'micro', 'giant', 'pimples', 'retin', 'flake', 'surrounding', 'pimple', 'dries', 'super', 'dark', 'leaving', 'dark', 'pigmented', 'scar', 'quit', 'retin', 'effaclar', 'duo', 'treatment', 'peroxide', 'hope', 'lighten', 'pimple', 'scars i', 'update', 'rocheposay', 'products', 'feel update', 'feb', 'returned', 'overly', 'effective', 'teenager', 'extreme', 'types excellent', 'acneprone']",heard manufacturer coupon paper effaclar duo start google info brandproducts amazon com read review product review promising obagi derm monthly breakout single product clean prevent cystic breakout product peter thomas roth cetaphil nt break oil counter product left blemish red bumpy mosquito bite break pu digesting leaf clean mineral product remove shiny refreshed cleansed clean soft not tight upper nt product tight leaf soothed clean fresh i effaclar mtoner complement slowly build effaclar including cystic red bump pimple hope answer retin micro giant pimple retin flake surrounding pimple dry super dark leaving dark pigmented scar quit retin effaclar duo treatment peroxide hope lighten pimple scars i update rocheposay product feel update feb returned overly effective teenager extreme types excellent acneprone,0.9842,positive

4,"before i steam on ahead with my review i'll fill you in on skin's background so you'll have an idea what i'm dealing with. if you can't be arsed reading the entire thing, read the bottom line.throughout my teens, i had good skin. i did have the occasional breakout around my time of the month but other than that, i managed to escape acne in my school years. same deal as i got older, my skin is combination of oily and dry in some places. in the past 2 years, (i'm 24) i started getting these absolutely gorgeous breakouts just under my chin and my neck, and they were entirely hormonal, by the way ladies, if you get the odd breakout around your period, whatever side breaks out is the ovary that ovulates apparently. anyway, these breakouts where large, under the skin numbers and they were pretty painful. i'm sorry to say that i am a picker. disgusting but i find it satisfying. obviously, i am insane. after about six months of 'dude, what is that on your neck?!' i went to the doctor, who prescribed zineryt which quickly got rid off the problem.some 18 months later i moved to ny (from ireland), and october 2013 i started a different pill, cerazette, and after about 9 weeks of various other side affects (nothing major) i started to break out around my chin and lower jaw in general. proper cystic acne. painful, and didn't always come to a head. it took me a while to realize it was my pill that was causing this, it looked terrible. red, painful and just plain abysmal, for someone who never really had acne. i came off cerazette and after about two weeks, there was a small improvement, but honestly, nothing major. i came off it in around february off this year. i tried zineryt again which, to my dismay, only improved it a small amount. i also tried burt's bee's acne targeted spot treatment, which in all fairness, i imagine would work pretty well for someone who had a few breakouts, as it did clear up my skin a bit. about 3 weeks ago i was speaking to a friend and she put me onto effaclar duo. she said she recommended it to everyone and it worked wonders for her, and in fairness, her skin was worse than mine.  she said i could order it online, however the benefit of living in nyc and not a small town in ireland is that i can now easily access such things. i bought this in duane reade by the way, not amazon, but i read all my reviews on amazon before purchasing. i think it was $31 altogether, and then after i week i purchased the foaming cleanser. anyway, i applied this when i got home and when i woke up the next day, i swear there was an improvement. i was practically skipping about my apartment. over the next few days i continued using it morning and night, after i gently cleansed my face. on day 3 i noticed my skin started getting tighter, and by the end of the day in work i noticed that it had become, dry, flaky and patchy under my make up. i knew this would happen so i wasn't surprised, but still, lizard skin = horrible. i applied avene cicalfate restorative cream to my dry skin but also kept using effaclar duo, i just skipped wearing make up for a few days and the dry skin passed as quickly as it arrived.its now just over 2 weeks later and my skin is about 80% better. the effaclar duo has reduced the redness and scaring as well as controlled the breakouts, plus its brought all those horrible lurker type spots to a head. some people act surprised when something like this makes them break out, they don't seem to get that its bringing everything to a head. it has to get a little bit worse before it can get better.seeing as i've rambled on long enough i may as well mention the difference in the european version and the american, which has 5% bp, unlike the french version. i mentioned to my friend (who, living in ireland, obviously used the french version) said that she too experienced the dry, flaky skin for a few days. however, i've found that if i use this too often it slightly burns my face, which is why i gave it 4 stars. lizard skin i can deal with, a red burning face for a few minutes is a bit much for 5 stars. also, its cheaper at home, around 14/15 gbp, which even with conversion, works out cheaper. benzoyl peroxide isn't exactly known to do wonders for the skin, so after my skin clears up i'm going to get my sister to airmail some off the french version, or just stock up when i return home.the foaming cleanser is nice, but i found using both right after each other doesn't help much with the burning skin sensation. possibly my skin is a tad more sensitive than i thought it was. furthermore, i've increased my water intake in an attempt to improve my skin, but bottom line, i'm pretty sure its the effaclar duo that's doing the hard work. pretty soon i hope to stop using my heavy duty mac concealer. speaking of which, i've also made sure i apply said concealer with clean brushes and sponges.apologies for long review, long & short off it, i recommend you give it a whirl!works well",La Roche-Posay,"['steam', 'background', 'idea', 'dealing', 'nt', 'arsed', 'reading', 'entire', 'read', 'line throughout', 'teens', 'occasional', 'breakout', 'managed',

4,up until recently i was on retinol for quite a while but my skin is cleared and i decided to stop the regimen. i have noticed a few blemishes here and there popping up again. you have to be very careful when on retinol and there are a lot of things you have to do and i didn't want to start that again so i decided to try this cream. i have been using it just as a spot reducer because i have very sensitive skin. they benzoyl peroxide is in a higher dose that i have ever used before so i went slow and small at first. this did not irritate my skin like i thought it would and that is a great surprise. i have noticed a little bit of flaking and the drying of skin but i think that's part of the blemish healing process. it definitely reduced the time that it's been taking for one of my pimples to heal. for me it's between three and five days and that's pretty good considering some of mine hang out for quite a while sometimes. overall i'm pretty pleased with this product.it actually does work pretty well it's a higher concentration than i've used before,La Roche-Posay,"['cleared', 'decided', 'regimen', 'blemishes', 'popping', 'careful', 'nt', 'start', 'decided', 'spot', 'reducer', 'benzoyl', 'peroxide', 'dose', 'slow', 'not', 'irritate', 'surprise', 'flaking', 'blemish', 'healing', 'process', 'reduced', 'pimples', 'heal', 'days', 'pretty', 'hang', 'pretty', 'pleased', 'product it', 'pretty', 'concentration']",cleared decided regimen blemish popping careful nt start decided spot reducer benzoyl peroxide dose slow not irritate surprise flaking blemish healing process reduced pimple heal day pretty hang pretty pleased product it pretty concentration,0.9327,positive
4,"i'm an adult with occasional acne, and have mixed feelings about this product. on one hand, i do think it shortened the ""life cycle"" of the pimples i've applied it too -- it took 3 ish days to go away as opposed to the usual 7 ish days if i applied right at the start of the pimple. the downside is that my skin hasn't loved it. the area around the pimple where the cream touched stings for a bit after applying the cream, and my skin turned red/flaky around the pimple as well. since i only use this once every few months for a spot treatment, i don't mind the reaction much for the trade-off on a shorter pimple life, but i wouldn't want to use this product regularly or over a large portion of my face. my skin runs slightly sensitive but not overly so, so for those with definitely sensitive skin i'd say find another brand/product.effective but caused redness/flaking of skin",La Roche-Posay,"['adult', 'occasional', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'shortened', 'life', 'cycle', 'pimples', 'applied', 'ish', 'days', 'opposed', 'usual', 'ish', 'days', 'applied', 'start', 'pimple', 'downside', 'nt', 'loved', 'pimple', 'touched', 'stings', 'redflaky', 'pimple', 'months', 'spot', 'treatment', 'nt', 'mind', 'reaction', 'tradeoff', 'shorter', 'pimple', 'life', 'nt', 'regularly', 'portion', 'runs', 'not', 'overly', 'brandproduct effective', 'caused', 'rednessflaking']",adult occasional mixed feeling shortened life cycle pimple applied ish day opposed usual ish day applied start pimple downside nt loved pimple touched sting redflaky pimple month spot treatment nt mind reaction tradeoff shorter pimple life nt regularly portion run not overly brandproduct effective caused rednessflaking,0.2134,positive
4,"i've been using la roche-posay sunscreen for years, and when i saw they made products for acne-prone skin i decided to give it a try. i also noticed the effaclar duo contains benzoyl peroxide, which has always been effective at treating my breakout-prone skin.

la roche-posay effaclar purifying foaming gel, 6.76-ounce tube
, wait about 5 minutes to allow my skin to dry, and then apply a small amount of the effaclar duo all over my face. the tube is small, but you really don't need a large amount of the product. after i've given it a few minutes to absorb into my skin i apply moisturizer. i recently started using 
la roche-posay toleriane fluid  1.35-ounces

5,"love how affordable and good cerave products are, so decided to try this as a ""dipping my toes in the water"" type of retinol product to help reduce fine lines and acne scars. after using this for a few months, here are some tips i'd like to share:- do not start nightly if you've never used a retinol product before! your skin needs time to adapt to new routines. i would recommend using once a week, then twice, etc., eventually you can use this safely every night.- it does not specify, but i do not recommend using this during the day, or if you really, really want to, please use sunscreen. this is because retinols are not as effective under sunlight and it causes your skin to be more sensitive to uv light, which will cause more damage long-term.- this works pretty slow compared to other retinols. i found it to be quite mild, so don't expect your ice pick scars or enlarged pores to show any difference any time soon. you really have to create a consistent skincare routine to see change.- do not stack your vitamin c, aha/bha toners, and acne products with this. i made this mistake when i first started using the serum and woke up with sensitive red skin with breakouts. now i only use vitamin c in the mornings, apply benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid as needed when not using this serum, and tone with aha/bha a couple of times in the week during the day- you should still moisturize, this serum isn't a replacement for face cream. your skin will only create more oil if it doesn't feel hydrated, so if you have oily/combo skin, find a non-greasy light moisturizer, but don't skip it!it's not a miraculous holy grail type of product, but i found that with consistency and patience, there are some visible results, so i will keep buying since it's non-prescription and not too expensive. my skin looks more smooth now, but there are still scars, so i think i will incorporate micro-needling into my regimen as well. this is a good product to add to your skincare routine, gentle enough to start using in your 20s. i wish i had known about lighter retinol products sooner - i used to think it was only for older people and that they are always harsh.works slow, use at night!!! affordable beginner retinol",CeraVe,"['love', 'affordable', 'products', 'decided', 'dipping', 'toes', 'water', 'type', 'fine', 'lines', 'scars', 'months', 'tips', 'share', 'not', 'start', 'nightly', 'adapt', 'routines', 'recommend', 'eventually', 'safely', 'not', 'not', 'recommend', 'retinols', 'not', 'effective', 'sunlight', 'uv', 'light', 'damage', 'longterm', 'pretty', 'slow', 'compared', 'retinols', 'mild', 'nt', 'expect', 'ice', 'pick', 'scars', 'enlarged', 'pores', 'create', 'consistent', 'change', 'not', 'stack', 'vitamin', 'ahabha', 'toners', 'products', 'mistake', 'woke', 'red', 'breakouts', 'vitamin', 'mornings', 'benzoyl', 'peroxidesalicylic', 'acid', 'not', 'tone', 'ahabha', 'couple', 'times', 'nt', 'create', 'nt', 'hydrated', 'oilycombo', 'nongreasy', 'light', 'nt', 'skip', 'not', 'miraculous', 'holy', 'grail', 'type', 'consistency', 'patience', 'visible', 'buying', 'nonprescription', 'not', 'expensive', 'smooth', 'scars', 'incorporate', 'microneedling', 'regimen', 'add', 'gentle', 'start', 'lighter', 'products', 'sooner', 'harsh works', 'slow', 'affordable', 'beginner']",love affordable product decided dipping toe water type fine line scar month tip share not start nightly adapt routine recommend eventually safely not not recommend retinol not effective sunlight uv light damage longterm pretty slow compared retinol mild nt expect ice pick scar enlarged pore create consistent change not stack vitamin ahabha toner product mistake woke red breakout vitamin morning benzoyl peroxidesalicylic acid not tone ahabha couple time nt create nt hydrated oilycombo nongreasy light nt skip not miraculous holy grail type consistency patience visible buying nonprescription not expensive smooth scar incorporate microneedling regimen add gentle start lighter product sooner harsh works slow affordable beginner,0.8972,positive

1,"update:i would not recommend this for any use. i finally gave up on using it for my morning spf, and tried to use at night etc as a retinol cream. no matter what i do, it pills terribly. i have tried so many different combinations in an effort to use a product i spent money on in, but nothing i do works. i would not recommend for any reason and am changing my review to one star.original review:i have only used this product for a week, but i feel that i can give a preliminary review at this point. i purchased this cream specifically for a daily spf. i have been on the hunt for an inexpensive spf that can be worn under makeup, which is quite a tall order for products <$20 usd.after a week use, i would not recommend this cream for anyone who uses multiple products in their pre-makeup skin care prep, or for anyone who uses medium to high coverage foundations. reason being, it pills. it pills if you put on a light layer, or a thick layer. i have waited anywhere between 15-30 minutes after applying to give it time to absorb, but that doesn’t seem to make any difference. it pills without even touching the skin, which is something i have not previously experienced. another reason i would not recommend for use under makeup is the drying effect, which i’m sure is the retinol. my skin is quite used to ahas. i chemically exfoliate regularly. even with skin that is used to a rigid routine, i find that the cream dries my skin out significantly. i must use a separate moisturizer mixed with it, or after. this is not necessarily a negative, however. it means that the retinol in the cream is a higher concentration, and will yield results.the reason i gave it four stars is the price and the quality. if you don’t wear makeup, or if you wear a bb/cc cream, i would totally recommend this for a daily spf, or as a separate retinol cream. it is very difficult to find a cream that has an spf, that sinks in and doesn’t leave you greasy, and that includes a retinol high in the ingredients list for less than $20.i will update my review as i get more use out of the cream.pills terribly!! would not recommend!!",CeraVe,"['update', 'not', 'recommend', 'matter', 'pills', 'terribly', 'combinations', 'effort', 'spent', 'money', 'not', 'recommend', 'reason', 'changing', 'star original', 'preliminary', 'hunt', 'inexpensive', 'worn', 'tall', 'products', 'usd after', 'not', 'recommend', 'multiple', 'products', 'premakeup', 'prep', 'medium', 'coverage', 'foundations', 'reason', 'pills', 'pills', 'light', 'layer', 'layer', 'waited', 'minutes', 'absorb', 'pills', 'touching', 'not', 'experienced', 'reason', 'not', 'recommend', 'ahas', 'chemically', 'exfoliate', 'regularly', 'rigid', 'dries', 'separate', 'mixed', 'not', 'negative', 'concentration', 'yield', 'results the', 'reason', 'stars', 'quality', 'bbcc', 'totally', 'recommend', 'separate', 'difficult', 'sinks', 'greasy', 'includes', 'ingredients', 'list', ' i', 'update', 'cream pills', 'terribly', 'not', 'recommend']",update not recommend matter pill terribly combination effort spent money not recommend reason changing star original preliminary hunt inexpensive worn tall product usd after not recommend multiple product premakeup prep medium coverage foundation reason pill pill light layer layer waited minute absorb pill touching not experienced reason not recommend ahas chemically exfoliate regularly rigid dry separate mixed not negative concentration yield results the reason star quality bbcc totally recommend separate difficult sink greasy includes ingredient list  i update cream pills terribly not recommend,-0.9524,negative

5,"this review comes from the female side of the family. the french company la roche-posay is a familiar and respected name to me but i hadn't run across their products for some time. then i got the chance to review a tube of this eye dark-circle treatment called ""pigmentclar"" and jumped at it. i don't use a lot of makeup, but i do suffer from dark circles under the eyes, so i always apply something before i go out.i have been using the pigmentclar product daily for a month and i am  impressed. let me say first that i'm hard to please with makeup or anything that goes near my eyes! if it stings at all, out it goes. it helps that this eye treatment is hypoallergenic, and free of paraben, alcohol and fragrance. like some other reviewers, i've suffered from allergies all my life and this seems to go with dark circles. i also want to say that i am light skinned, so my circles just look like a kind of bruising -- not perhaps the very dark circles some of you ladies of darker skin may have. i don't know if or how this would work for you. for me, this product is just right.i've long used cosmetic dark circle concealer, but i have to say, some of it looks artificial, a heavy cover up that is obvious. i don't like that. what's great about this product is that, while it does have pigment in it (mostly zinc oxide like you get in sunblock), it is mostly light and translucent. it is a little ""opalescent"" -- part of how it conceals is that it reflects light. it does have finely ground mica in it, so maybe that is why.the end result is that i get the degree of lightening under the eyes i like, without it looking like it's painted on. this is a cosmetic, but it is also a skin treatment, given the ingredients. so while it does help you cover, it is also treating fine and tender skin with a number of good ingredients. the company tells us the water is from a spring that has a lot of selenium in it, known to help heal eczema and other dermatological problems.you dot the product around the eyes with the cooling metal applicator tip. you could smooth it with that tip as well, but to tell the truth, i find i use too much when i apply it that way. i prefer to dispense a little on a fingertip, and then dab it on.i trust this product to be safe for my skin. i looked up most of the ingredients and discovered that they are ruled safe in europe as well as the states. in fact, i'm so impressed with la roche-posay that i'm going to try their anti-aging line as well. i looked up their website and signed up for the newsletter (and there's no way i'm saying that just for the price of a tube of eye treatment!).i'm delighted to have renewed my acquaintance with the company, and that their products are as good as i remember.recommended!delighted!

5,"i love the la roche-posay pigmentclar dark circle eye cream so far because it's thick and easily absorbed. you need just a bit and it blends in quite well. it doesn't leave a slick residue on my top lids like my other eye cream. i'm glad because it's easier to apply eye shadow over this product.i have some sun spots near my eyes--since eye creams don't come with spf!--that i'd like to lighten. i'm hoping the ingredient phe-resorcinol in this product will help with these spots since they're touted with lightening melanin. i'll update as i use this more. in the meantime, it blends in easily and feels smooth and well-absorbed.the one thing i don't care for is the chrome tip (as seen in the photo) that you are supposed to use to dab the cream on your eye. it's ice cold and entirely unpleasant for me. i just use my finger.my guess is that the phe-resorcinol takes more than a week to begin lightening. i have another product i used for melasma, and that took about a month to see marked differences. i was doing a study for skin cream, and the photographers couldn't believe the differences from the month before. so i'll give this a month.blends nicely, easy to apply makeup over",La Roche-Posay,"['love', 'rocheposay', 'pigmentclar', 'dark', 'circle', 'easily', 'absorbed', 'blends', 'nt', 'slick', 'residue', 'lids', 'glad', 'easier', 'shadow', 'product i', 'spots', 'eyes', 'creams', 'nt', 'lighten', 'hoping', 'pheresorcinol', 'spots', 'touted', 'lightening', 'melanin', 'update', 'blends', 'easily', 'feels', 'smooth', 'wellabsorbed the', 'nt', 'chrome', 'photo', 'supposed', 'dab', 'ice', 'cold', 'unpleasant', 'finger my', 'guess', 'pheresorcinol', 'takes', 'lightening', 'melasma', 'marked', 'differences', 'study', 'photographers', 'nt', 'differences', 'month blends', 'nicely', 'easy']",love rocheposay pigmentclar dark circle easily absorbed blend nt slick residue lid glad easier shadow product i spot eye cream nt lighten hoping pheresorcinol spot touted lightening melanin update blend easily feel smooth wellabsorbed the nt chrome photo supposed dab ice cold unpleasant finger my guess pheresorcinol take lightening melasma marked difference study photographer nt difference month blends nicely easy,0.959,positive

4,"la roche-posay is a renowned brand known for its dermatologist-recommended skincare products. their pure retinol face serum with vitamin b3 is designed to address multiple skincare concerns, including fine lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and texture. here's a review of this product:pros:1. effective retinol: retinol is a potent ingredient known for its ability to improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and promote cell turnover. la roche-posay uses pure retinol in this serum, making it an effective anti-aging product.2. vitamin b3 (niacinamide): vitamin b3, or niacinamide, is an excellent addition to this serum. it helps to soothe and strengthen the skin's barrier, reduce redness, and even out skin tone. the combination of retinol and niacinamide can address a range of skin concerns, from signs of aging to discoloration.3. lightweight and non-greasy: i appreciate the lightweight and non-greasy texture of this serum. it absorbs well into the skin, making it suitable for various skin types, including oily and combination skin.4. fragrance-free: la roche-posay is known for its commitment to fragrance-free skincare products, making this serum suitable for sensitive skin that might react negatively to added fragrances.5. dermatologist-tested: the brand's dermatologist-tested claim adds a layer of credibility to the product's safety and efficacy, assuring consumers that it has been evaluated by skincare professionals.cons:1. potential irritation: retinol, especially pure retinol, can be irritating to some individuals, especially when first introducing it into their skincare routine. it's recommended to start slowly and build up tolerance to minimize potential side effects like dryness, redness, or peeling.2. price: la roche-posay is a premium skincare brand, and as such, their products tend to be more expensive compared to some drugstore alternatives. while the quality justifies the price for many users, it might not fit everyone's budget.3. sun sensitivity: retinol can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. it's crucial to use sunscreen daily when using this serum to protect your skin from uv damage.in conclusion, la roche-posay's pure retinol face serum with vitamin b3 is a solid choice for those seeking an effective anti-aging and skin-renewing serum. its combination of pure retinol and niacinamide addresses a wide range of skincare concerns, and its fragrance-free formula makes it suitable for sensitive skin. if you're looking to incorporate retinol into your skincare routine, this

4,"i bought this on a whim as i was running out of my usual cleanser (that i buy imported from japan), and my friend recommended to me.  i have to admit, i have mixed feelings about this cleanser.to preface, i am asian with oily skin, but i'm of the opinion that oily skin is a result of skin dehydration, so i don't mind (and in fact often use) moisturizing products for my skincare.  here are my thoughts as an oily skin gal using this cleanser- it doesn't foam up, but has a gel-like lotiony consistency, spreads easily on face, and very gentle.- i don't think it cleans as well as my old cleanser, but it's somewhat to be expected as this is meant to be gentle and non-stripping if it's going to work for dry and sensitive skin.  however, it's not to say that it doesn't clean my face - but it doesn't give me that squeaky clean feeling- in fact, i feel like it leaves a sliiiiiiiiiiiight residue/layer on my skin, which i normally would hate but in this case it's so slight, i haven't minded it too much.  however, i really do want to note that since switching to this cleanser, the pores around my nose seems to be less clean than they used to be, which is a bummer.- the residue it leaves feels smooth and a little...silicony?  there's no silicon in the ingredients but, woah i just looked at it, got a lot of alcohols, as well as sulfate and parabens.  uh...well the good news is, it haven't done anything bad to my skin!  (note that i have not done enough research to know if the particular types of these things included are all bad or not)- despite the residue feeling, i have very sensitive skin and this have not broken me out at all, so that's a great thing.- of note, when using this it seems to...make my skin feel a little weird.  specifically around my mouth area (not on my lips, but for example the skin between my nose and mouth), it kinda tingles/numbs/heats up.  it's not completely painful but it does get more sensitive the longer i keep this on my face.  that said, it has not broken me out, nor made my skin react badly afterwards.- after using, my skin does not feel stripped or dry, but i follow up with my usual toner/lotion/moisturizer anyway so it doesn't really matter.i have mixed feeling about this cleanser.  i like that it doesn't strip my skin, but i don't like that it doesn't clean as well and leaves a slight residue.  i like that the residue doesn't bother me too bad.  i don't think i like the ingredients, but i'm pretty happy that it haven't broken me out or made me more oily (which, i've tried some cleansers that really stripped my skin and made my skin feel a lot worse).  i'm not a huge fan of the consistency, but i don't hate it.  i do not like the numbing feeling, but it haven't ruined my skin either so i'm not sure its importance (there are peels/scrubs that also makes my skin burn but are obviously expected, i'm not sure if there are such ingreds in this to cause the numbing).so yeah...definitely mixed feelings on this thing lolrather difficult to describe this cleanser",CeraVe,"['running', 'usual', 'imported', 'japan', 'friend', 'recommended', 'admit', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'cleanser to', 'preface', 'asian', 'opinion', 'result', 'dehydration', 'nt', 'mind', 'products', 'gal', 'nt', 'gellike', 'lotiony', 'consistency', 'spreads', 'easily', 'gentle', 'nt', 'cleans', 'expected', 'meant', 'gentle', 'nonstripping', 'not', 'nt', 'clean', 'nt', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'leaves', 'sliiiiiiiiiiiight', 'residuelayer', 'hate', 'slight', 'nt', 'minded', 'note', 'switching', 'pores', 'nose', 'clean', 'bummer', 'residue', 'leaves', 'feels', 'smooth', 'silicony', 'silicon', 'ingredients', 'woah', 'looked', 'alcohols', 'sulfate', 'parabens', 'uh', 'news', 'nt', 'bad', 'note', 'not', 'types', 'included', 'bad', 'not', 'residue', 'not', 'broken', 'note', 'weird', 'mouth', 'not', 'lips', 'nose', 'mouth', 'kinda', 'tinglesnumbsheats', 'not', 'completely', 'painful', 'not', 'broken', 'react', 'badly', 'not', 'stripped', 'follow', 'usual', 'tonerlotionmoisturizer', 'nt', 'matter i', 'mixed', 'nt', 'strip', 'nt', 'nt', 'clean', 'leaves', 'slight', 'residue', 'residue', 'nt', 'bother', 'bad', 'nt', 'ingredients', 'pretty', 'happy', 'nt', 'broken', 'cleansers', 'stripped', 'worse', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'consistency', 'nt', 'hate', 'not', 'numbing', 'nt', 'ruined', 'not', 'peelsscrubs', 'burn', 'expected', 'not', 'ingreds', 'numbing', 'yeah', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'lolrather', 'difficult']",running usual imported japan friend recommended admit mixed feeling cleanser to preface asian opinion result dehydration nt mind product gal nt gellike lotiony consistency spread easily gentle nt clean expected meant gentle nonstripping not nt clean nt squeaky clean leaf sliiiiiiiiiiiight residuelayer hate slight nt minded note switching pore nose clean bummer residue leaf feel smooth silicony silicon ingredient woah looked alcohol sulfate parabens uh news nt bad note not type included bad not residue not broken note weird mouth not lip nose mouth kinda tinglesnumbsheats not completely painful not broken react badly not stripped follow usual tonerlotionmoisturizer nt matter i mixed nt strip nt nt clean leaf slight residue residue nt bother bad nt ingredient pretty happy nt broken cleanser stripped worse not huge fan consistency nt hate not numbing nt ruined not peelsscrubs burn expected not ingreds numbing yeah mixed feeling lolrather difficult,0.766,positive

5,"skincare reviews are hard to be trusted. many people write reviews after a few days or a couple of weeks of using the skincare. often people are writing reviews before their skin has fully adjusted to the product. also there are a lot of questionable ethics that some of these lesser known companies are using so long story short - if the skincare product is highly rated on amazon but you've never heard of it - google the brand and look for forums and not review sites - forums have people who are passionate about skincare having lengthy discussions and that's where you find the most honest info. it is possible for an item to be a ""verified purchase"" but isn't truly an honest review. a lot of people make money as full time reviewers so the more reviews they have, the more brands will want to work with them, and brands don't want to see a lot of negative reviews. sorry to ramble, i just feel bad for people who buy into the hype of some of these ""amazon famous"" brands that are mediocre at best.this is great for dry skin. it took me about 6 months to stop hating it. until about 30, my skin was an oil well, so i always used cleansers that were foaming. so as i got older and my skin got drier and drier, i continued to use the foaming cleansers for the squeaky clean feeling. well it turns out that squeaky clean feeling was actually my skin being stripped of oil... which may have been ok when my skin was an oil well but was not ok when my skin became naturally dry.  it was really hard to get used to this cleanser because i didn't ""feel"" anything. like it didn't feel clean, and as i cleansed my skin with it i always thought ""is this removing any dirt from my face?"" but it was, i just wasn't used to my face not feeling dried out lol. for those who are asking why this may not be working or why your skin still feels dry after washing you may want to read up on hyaluronic acid. it is known as a moisturizing ingredient however, the way it works is that it moisturizes your face by pulling moisture from the air - so if it's winter and your environment is super dry with the heat vents or if you live in a dry climate, this still can work really well - just make sure you put on a really great moisturizer after washing your face so that the hyaluronic acid pulls the moisture from there to deposit it on your skin. and also use google because i'm just a chick who read some articles, not a profesh!! so anyway, the cerave brand is great and this purchase is well worth it. i spent all of my 20s wasting exorbitant money on skincare until i discovered ingredient lists and skincare forums - isn't it funny how we get so duped into thinking expensive=better?

 i’ve been using this face wash for the past year and it’s done my skin wonders !! 😫 my skin tends to be kinda dry but slightly oily in my t zone and around my nostrils. i’m also prone to breakouts, and anything scented tends to make things worse. i could never find a skincare routine that fully worked for me and made the breakouts stop. i was putting in so much work for little results, and then i started using this stuff and let me tell you- my skin has never looked/felt so good !! at first, i noticed i was still dealing with some blemishes and almost stopped using this stuff cause i thought it was the face wash’s fault but it turns out it’s because i wasn’t using it properly (oops). make sure to use a wash cloth when washing your face! i was uneducated and didn’t realize that by not using a wash cloth, i was leaving some of the face wash trapped on my skin and it was clogging my pores and causing the pimples. so make sure to at least use a clean wash cloth when rinsing it off, if not for the entire wash and rinse process. also, this doesn’t just apply to this face wash, it’s apparently common skincare knowledge that i was just unaware of (like i said, it wasn’t the face wash’s fault y’all)! i now am happy to say that i haven’t had a breakout or uneven skin in many months. i make sure to use it twice a day, morning and night, and for me personally i apply paula’s choice pore reducing toner with a cotton pad afterwards (use toner while your skin is still wet!) and then usually vitamin c serum, a couple drops of jojoba oil, and some spf on top during the day. i dab off any extra oiliness with a paper towel (don’t rub the paper towel on your face it’s not good for your poor sensitive skin 😭) at night i wash my face, use the toner, and then some jojoba oil, rosehip seed oil, or the ordinary’s 1% retinol in squalane depending on what i feel my skin needs (also if you wanna start using a retinol serum, i highly recommend doing some research first so you know what you’re getting into/how often to use it!) overall, this stuff feels great on my face and isn’t too thick and it doesn’t leave any weird residue feeling like some face washes have in the past. it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and balanced, no more dry or oily spots! i also love that the bottle is easy to take with me places because i travel a lot. it has a cool little c shaped clip that goes under the pump to keep it from leaking in your bag which is an honest lifesaver. the bottle is durable too/it’s not about to get crushed in my bag under all my stuff. overall, i highly recommend this face wash for anyone with sensitive skin!!my favorite face wash! great for sensitive skin!",La Roche-Posay,"['media', 'not', 'loaded', 'wonders', 'kinda', 'zone', 'nostrils', 'prone', 'breakouts', 'scented', 'worse', 'breakouts', 'putting', 'lookedfelt', 'dealing', 'blemishes', 'stopped', 'fault', 'properly', 'oops', 'cloth', 'washing', 'uneducated', 'realize', 'not', 'cloth', 'leaving', 'trapped', 'clogging', 'pores', 'causing', 'pimples', 'clean', 'cloth', 'rinsing', 'not', 'entire', 'rinse', 'process', 'common', 'knowledge', 'unaware', 'fault', 'happy', 'breakout', 'uneven', 'months', 'personally', 'paula', 'choice', 'pore', 'reducing', 'toner', 'cotton', 'pad', 'toner', 'wet', 'vitamin', 'couple', 'drops', 'jojoba', 'dab', 'extra', 'oiliness', 'paper', 'towel', 'paper', 'towel', 'not', 'poor', 'toner', 'jojoba', 'rosehip', 'seed', 'ordinary', 'squalane', 'depending', 'wan', 'start', 'highly', 'recommend', 'intohow', 'feels', 'weird', 'residue', 'washes', 'leaves', 'balanced', 'spots', 'love', 'easy', 'travel', 'cool', 'shaped', 'clip', 'leaking', 'honest', 'lifesaver', 'durable', 'tooit', 'not', 'crushed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'favorite']",medium not loaded wonder kinda zone nostril prone breakout scented worse breakout putting lookedfelt dealing blemish stopped fault properly oops cloth washing uneducated realize not cloth leaving trapped clogging pore causing pimple clean cloth rinsing not entire rinse process common knowledge unaware fault happy breakout uneven month personally paula choice pore reducing toner cotton pad toner wet vitamin couple drop jojoba dab extra oiliness paper towel paper towel not poor toner jojoba rosehip seed ordinary squalane depending wan start highly recommend intohow feel weird residue wash leaf balanced spot love easy travel cool shaped clip leaking honest lifesaver durable tooit not crushed highly recommend favorite,0.9791,positive

(my skin is so sensitive that when i used any other face wash for less than 2min it would burn n leave a red scar on my face especially around my nose n mouth area i would then have to apply aloe burn cream)the face moisture is definitely doing what it says super moisturising and light weight no greasy or too oily feel to the skin leaving your face looking glowing and hydrating. i already placed an order for my next bottle to come.super hydration!!! highly recommend!!!,La Roche-Posay,"['fave', 'products', 'them before', 'start', 'stating', 'start', 'stating', 'type', 'concerns', 'days', 'extra', 'humid', 'not', 'bcz', 'btw', 'products', 'ppl', 'highly', 'nose', 'migraines', 'triggered', 'scents', 'me the', 'super', 'gentle', 'clean', 'burn', 'red', 'scar', 'nose', 'mouth', 'aloe', 'burn', 'super', 'moisturising', 'light', 'weight', 'greasy', 'leaving', 'glowing', 'come super', 'hydration', 'highly', 'recommend']",fave product them before start stating start stating type concern day extra humid not bcz btw product ppl highly nose migraine triggered scent me the super gentle clean burn red scar nose mouth aloe burn super moisturising light weight greasy leaving glowing come super hydration highly recommend,0.9719,positive

5,"this is my folliculitis journey and i include all the products i used to get rid of it.i got folliculitis on my groin area, i had no idea what it was since i have never had it but it started spreading down my legs and leaving these dark marks/scars. the lesions started multiplying, i went to the doctors who gave me an ointment gel, which did absolutely nothing for me, it was an acne treatment.since it started getting hotter and summer was near i knew i had to act fast or else i would have to wear pants all summer. first things first, from my research it states not to shave to prevent he spread of folliculitis, so yes i did just that. i didn't shave for over a month...i know gross but it had to be done.*if you do decide to shave, use a new fresh blade every time you shave in order to prevent spread. also if you have folliculitis on your legs don't use the same blade on your armpits etc.i looked up items on amazon and read reviews for ""almond clear: body clearing serum"" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0866b6cv1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=utf8&th=1i decided to give it a try, i started with level 1 and used it with the hibliclens antibacterial soap as everyone in the reviews did. i already had the soap since its so amazing and i recommend everyone have thissoap in their home it works miracles. i was already using this soap by itself for about 2 weeks prior to buying the almond clear bottle and i noticed no difference. when i read that buyers were combining both almond clear serum and the soap i decided to do the same, but still i felt that hibliclens did not do much for me. my folliculitis was very stubborn!https://www.amazon.com/molnlycke-hibiclens-hibiclens-liq-oz/dp/b00e5r65sa/ref=sr_1_3?crid=gnsu7pu7yven&dchild=1&keywords=hibiclens&qid=1590613599&refinements=p_85%3a2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=hibi%2caps%2c234&sr=8-3*everyone is different so what works for someone might not work for others.as for the almond clear serum, i noticed immediately a difference! overnight the lesions seemed like they shrunk.the only complaint is that the bottle doesn't contain much. i had a big area to cover so 1 bottle was finished in 1 week. i would definitely recommend you purchase the bigger bottle so its worth your money (they have the 4oz option available). also level 1 is more for someone who might have like 1-4 lesions..or for sensitive areas like the face. i felt like it made a difference but i definitely needed something stronger to completely get rid of them, i should've skipped to level2 like everyone else did in the reviews.i bought level 2 when i ran out of level 1 and i definitely noticed a huge difference! listen to me right now, if you suffer from severe folliculitis you have to buy this!honestly my case got so bad i had so many lesions on my groin area they started spreading down to my thighs and legs and even my private area :(i was so stressed i couldn't wear shorts and even pants would cause me to breakout in hives and the infected areawould get so red and irritated easily. it got bad!luckily this product saved my life..i started using this april 20, today is may 27 and i am pretty much cured, the lesions are all gone and even the scars are faded! this product faded the nasty dark marks.the reviews recommend using up to 2xs a day. this did not work for me, my skin is very sensitive so i would only use 1x a day, every night after i showered i would apply and leave overnight. i do have to say that this product makes your skin peel and drys your skin out. for me, it made my skin excessively dry and i would shed skin almost everyday.because my skin was getting beyond dry i decided to moisturize. i used cerave moistorizing lotion every morning when i woke up.*(make sure to always wash your hands before and after you apply a product to prevent from spreading to other body parts).https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b000yj2slg/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1i used this lotion because alot of people with skin issues use this lotion and it works well, i had no issues, great product!i shower every night so i decided to use a folliculitis body wash i found on amazon. i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then i rinse. i also noticed a big difference with this product right after the 1st use! i used this product for about 1.5 months?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00gbl3res/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=utf8&psc=1another product i used in the shower was the nizoral shampoo. i saw youtube videos of people who used it on their arms and face to treat folliculitis. luckily i already had this shampoo as well, its to treat dandruff, i recommend for both dandruff and for folliculitis, i feel like this items made a difference. i replaced the hibliclens soap with this product, i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then rinse in the shower. i used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00ainmfac/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1the final product i used was defense soap, i used this soap in order to kill any bacteria or fungi that might have been causing the folliculitis. i felt like this also made a difference and i washed my whole body with this in order to prevent any folliculitis from spreading on my stomach or arms...i was terrified of getting it any where else, the soap makes you feel fresh and clean specially after a workout! it does dry your skin so you don't have to use everyday, but if you do i would definitely recommend to moisturize with the cerave lotion or just any lotion in general. i used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b07hybk2yf/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1*be sure to use these products everyday, to see results you have to be consistent.if you are on a budget: out of all the products i would definitely recommend you use the almond clear serum and the folliculitis body wash by ovante. yes i know this is a very long routine and so many products to use, but all my folliculitis is pretty much gone already! it is pricey to buy all these items, but honestly i was willing to pay $100+ in order to get rid of this and it was worth it!i guess it depends how bad do you want to get rid of this? i think its worth it!do your research, find out what works for you, try different products until you find something that works for your skin. i hope this helps someone!amazing",CeraVe,"['folliculitis', 'journey', 'include', 'products', 'rid', 'it i', 'folliculitis', 'groin', 'idea', 'spreading', 'legs', 'leaving', 'dark', 'marksscars', 'lesions', 'multiplying', 'doctors', 'ointment', 'absolutely', 'treatment since', 'hotter', 'summer', 'fast', 'pants', 'summer', 'not', 'shave', 'prevent', 'folliculitis', 'nt', 'shave', 'gross', 'decide', 'shave', 'fresh', 'blade', 'shave', 'prevent', 'folliculitis', 'legs', 'nt', 'blade', 'armpits', 'etc i', 'looked', 'items', 'amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'almond', 'clearing', 'https', 'www amazon ', 'decided', 'level', 'hibliclens', 'antibacterial', 'soap', 'reviews', 'soap', 'amazing', 'recommend', 'thissoap', 'miracles', 'soap', 'weeks', 'prior', 'buying', 'almond', 'read', 'buyers', 'combining', 'almond', 'soap', 'decided', 'hibliclens', 'not', 'folliculitis', 'stubborn', 'https', 'www amazon ', 'keywordshibiclens', 'sprefixhibi', 'not', 'others as', 'almond', 'overnight', 'lesions', 'shrunk the', 'complaint', 'nt', 'cover', 'finished', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'bigger', 'worth', 'money', 'option', 'level', 'lesions', 'stronger', 'completely', 'rid', 'skipped', 'reviews i', 'level', 'level', 'huge', 'listen', 'suffer', 'severe', 'folliculitis', 'bad', 'lesions', 'groin', 'spreading', 'thighs', 'legs', 'private', 'stressed', 'nt', 'shorts', 'pants', 'breakout', 'hives', 'infected', 'areawould', 'red', 'irritated', 'easily', 'bad', 'luckily', 'saved', 'life', 'april', 'pretty', 'cured', 'lesions', 'scars', 'faded', 'faded', 'nasty', 'dark', 'marks the', 'reviews', 'recommend', 'not', 'showered', 'overnight', 'peel', 'drys', 'excessively', 'everyday because', 'decided', 'moistorizing', 'woke', 'hands', 'prevent', 'spreading', 'https', 'www amazon ', 'alot', 'issues', 'issues', 'shower', 'decided', 'folliculitis', 'amazon', 'mins', 'rinse', ' ', 'months', 'https', 'www amazon ', 'shower', 'nizoral', 'shampoo', 'youtube', 'videos', 'arms', 'treat', 'folliculitis', 'luckily', 'shampoo', 'treat', 'dandruff', 'recommend', 'dandruff', 'folliculitis', 'items', 'replaced', 'hibliclens', 'soap', 'mins', 'rinse', 'shower', 'month https', 'www amazon ', 'final', 'defense', 'soap', 'soap', 'kill', 'bacteria', 'fungi', 'causing', 'folliculitis', 'washed', 'prevent', 'folliculitis', 'spreading', 'stomach', 'arms', 'terrified', 'soap', 'fresh', 'clean', 'specially', 'workout', 'nt', 'recommend', 'month https', 'www amazon ', 'products', 'consistent if', 'budget', 'products', 'recommend', 'almond', 'folliculitis', 'ovante', 'products', 'folliculitis', 'pretty', 'pricey', 'items', 'pay', 'rid', 'worth', 'guess', 'depends', 'bad', 'rid', 'worth', 'products', 'hope', 'helps', 'amazing']",folliculitis journey include product rid it i folliculitis groin idea spreading leg leaving dark marksscars lesion multiplying doctor ointment absolutely treatment since hotter summer fast pant summer not shave prevent folliculitis nt shave gross decide shave fresh blade shave prevent folliculitis leg nt blade armpit etc i looked item amazon read review almond clearing http www amazon  decided level hibliclens antibacterial soap review soap amazing recommend thissoap miracle soap week prior buying almond read buyer combining almond soap decided hibliclens not folliculitis stubborn http www amazon  keywordshibiclens sprefixhibi not others as almond overnight lesion shrunk the complaint nt cover finished recommend purchase bigger worth money option level lesion stronger completely rid skipped reviews i level level huge listen suffer severe folliculitis bad lesion groin spreading thigh leg private stressed nt short pant breakout hive infected areawould red irritated easily bad luckily saved life april pretty cured lesion scar faded faded nasty dark marks the review recommend not showered overnight peel dry excessively everyday because decided moistorizing woke hand prevent spreading http www amazon  alot issue issue shower decided folliculitis amazon min rinse   month http www amazon  shower nizoral shampoo youtube video arm treat folliculitis luckily shampoo treat dandruff recommend dandruff folliculitis item replaced hibliclens soap min rinse shower month https www amazon  final defense soap soap kill bacteria fungi causing folliculitis washed prevent folliculitis spreading stomach arm terrified soap fresh clean specially workout nt recommend month https www amazon  product consistent if budget product recommend almond folliculitis ovante product folliculitis pretty pricey item pay rid worth guess depends bad rid worth product hope help amazing,0.9887,positive
5,"as you can see from all of the positive and thoughtful reviews here, cerave's standard lotion (this product) is a fantastic moisturizer (and likewise, most everything they make is spectacular). this is really top-notch skin care.cerave is often mentioned in the same sentence with lotions and creams from companies like cetaphil and vanicream. these are products made not just to give you serious skin care, but made in a fashion to avoid ingredients that can make sensitive skin very irritated. they make expensive lotions, creams, soaps, and sunscreen, but they make very, very, very high-quality products that give the best performance you can get (in fact, this stuff is so good that numerous independent reviews have identified products from cerave, cetaphil, and vanicream to be superior to many of the ""designer"" skin care products that often cost hundreds of dollars per bottle!!! further, ask a dermatologist [or an allergist who specializes in skin conditions] which moisturizer they prefer and you will most likely hear one of those three names!!!)i happen to be one of those people that if i apply a lotion or cream with one or more of the (many) ingredients that tends to irritate sensitive skin, 10 minutes later you might freak out from seeing a person who is (literally) the color red and call 911. no lie...certain irritants cause me to have a reaction that could only be described as ""freaky"". as cerave is built on the reputation of making non-irritating products, this lotion (and most all of their product line) is a blessing for people like me (vanicream applies here as well.) but the ""non-irritating"" aspect is just one of the reasons these products are so great...their performance in how well they moisturize and help repair damaged skin is another reason for such great reputations.like the other names mentioned above, cerave makes a few skin care products for different uses and applications. this particular one is their standard lotion, and it is their ""lighter"" moisturizer (with their creams being heavier). made to work well for everyone and designed to be a great ""day"" moisturizer for people of all skin types & conditions, it gives...---excellent immediate relief from that itchy feeling from dryness and feeling or irritation,---healing at a much faster speed than without the usage or with any standard lotion, and---long-lasting protection (one application will get you through the day).also, it is...---well-suited to people with sensitivities to irritants & those suffering from any of a long list of major skin conditions---not greasy once worked in,---designed not to clog pores and not to irritate acne,---very easy to work in,---wears lightly without any feeling of ""residue,"" and---works great as a post-shave lotion for reducing irritation/razor burn without causing further irritation that some after-shave lotions can do.my personal usage of this product is (in combination with a few products from cetaphil, vanicream lite, gold bond, eurcerin, and aveeno [depending which is on sale/available]) as my 'day moisturizer'. at night, i use vanicream's original cream, which is a fantastic cream, but it is heavy and not something i want to wear during the day. this cerave is much easier to work in, wears lightly without any residue feeling, but still delivers powerful healing to skin and lasts a long time. so a little bit of this cerave in the morning and i am good until the end of the day when i shower***.the biggest downside here is price. cerave is a premium product, and so it comes at a premium price. with that said, your money isn't only going ""to the name"" because this product works exceptionally well and i personally feel its performance justifies its price many times over. the difference it can make can be tremendous, and better skin often means an improvement in quality of life, which is something you can't put a price tag on. so if you are considering trying cerave, my personal advice is that you should go for it as you will most likely be very satisfied with the outcome.(***if you have serious dry skin, check out cerave's or vanicream's creams; this for the day and the cream at night can tackle serious skin issues like a champ!)top-notch skin care!!!

5,"i recently purchased the la roche-posay toleriane double repair uv spf moisturizer for my mom, who has always been stubborn when it comes to protecting her skin from the sun. she's tried various sunscreens in the past but found them to be too oily, which made her reluctant to use them consistently. however, this moisturizer with spf 30 has been a true revelation for her, and i couldn't be happier.first and foremost, what sets this moisturizer apart is its ability to address my mom's specific concerns. it not only provides essential sun protection with spf 30 but also incorporates niacinamide and glycerin, which work together to hydrate and nourish the skin. this combination of benefits ensures that her skin stays moisturized and protected without feeling heavy or greasy.my mom's glowing review of this product revolves around its non-oily formula. she was initially skeptical, as previous sunscreens left her with a shiny and uncomfortable residue on her skin. however, this moisturizer pleasantly surprised her. it absorbs quickly and leaves her skin feeling smooth and matte, eliminating any concerns about an overly oily appearance. it has truly won her over with its lightweight and non-greasy texture.as her daughter, it brings me comfort to know that my mom is finally taking proper care of her skin. the la roche-posay toleriane double repair uv spf moisturizer not only satisfies her pickiness when it comes to sunscreen but also provides her with the protection she needs. it's a relief to see her embrace a product that keeps her skin safe from the harmful

5,"at 52, i have reached the point where my love of sun and hatred of sunscreen back in the day, have produced pre-cancerous spots on my face and chest - oh yay. i promised my dermatologist that i’d use a moisturizer with sunscreen. ugh… have you noticed how many are out there that give the dreaded “white cast” on your face or are so thick feeling on your skin you swear its a joke and your husband replaced it with pudding on april fools day.but not this stuff!!!! i did the searches and read articles trying to find something that (first) wasn’t heavy, didn’t make me look like casper the friendly ghost, or smelled like sunblock. i used ole’s newly created 30 spf moisturizer sunscreen but it felt sticky and didn’t feel “healthy” on my face, if that makes sense. i was devastated because i love all things ole.then i decided that i’d give this stuff a go. game changer! it smells nice, isn’t heavy, and has a very minimal white cast (and that’s only if you use a ton; which you won’t because a little goes a long way!) now remember i said i was a sun loving kid and lived through the “baby oil is best sunblock,” so i have some dark spots, little lines, discolorations etc. literally everything stereotypical of my generation.

5,"i've heard about this for a while now & finally decided to give it a try. the very first time, i put it on my face, i could tell it was a different kind of moisturizer.(btw, if you are experiencing ""pilling"" and flaking with this, i would verify the authenticity. i had no problems like that and my face was clean but not freshly washed. the next time i used it, i used sunscreen over it and had no problems either. try checking with la roche online to see if you can verify by the markings on the container.)pros:--the texture is light but not thin. i didn't have to use but a pea-sized amount for each half of my face and another for my neck.-- no fragrance at all.-- it glides very easily onto the skin. after i applied it and let it rest for about a full minute, my skin was so soft that it felt a bit ""padded"". i couldn't feel the moisturizer because it had completely absorbed. btw, the first time i used this, i purposely used nothing else - no hyaluronic or toner or anything.-- the results are pretty incredible and i can use the phrase about my skin feeling soft as a baby's bottom!my face did have a very slight tingling after the first application. it wasn't unpleasant but i kept an eye on it just in case. it abated after a while. i was reading somewhere that the tingling could be due to either a sensitivity to the level of niacinamide or because my skin barrier is compromised. in any case, i did not have this problem with the next application.con:--the outer box was unsealed and there was no foil or plastic seal protecting the lotion. this made me hesitate and i wonder if other users had a seal or not. my tube seemed a bit flat also - like there might be some cream missing.overall: this is a straight win & i will even call it a holy grail product. even in between applying this moisturizer, i feel like i have had a fresh facial, an exfoliation, some serum, and a moisturizer. since this worked so well, the only other thing i wanted to test was how long the hydration lasts. on the first day, i put it on as soon as i got the package (at about 5 pm) and decided to see if my face was still moisturized when waking the next morning. the result? yes, my face was just as supple and hydrated as when i went to sleep. it's humid here and i usually end up wiping moisturizers and sunscreens off while constantly patting my face dry. i am not having to reapply this, no matter how many times i blot my face during the day.i have already ordered the version with spf but went direct to the u.s. site. i don't like that my tube seemed not to be quite full. there was no safety seal so i have no idea if it was used or what. plus, i get samples if i buy from the official site.my 62nd birthday is today and while i have good skin, i am getting those little dark ""freckles"" (aka age spots! lol), and just after a few days of using this, my skin looks and feels more supple and healthy. i can almost swear the age spots are getting less noticeable!it's next-level good",La Roche-Posay,"['heard', 'decided', 'btw', 'experiencing', 'pilling', 'flaking', 'verify', 'authenticity', 'clean', 'not', 'freshly', 'washed', 'checking', 'roche', 'online', 'verify', 'markings', 'pros', 'light', 'not', 'nt', 'peasized', 'neck', 'glides', 'easily', 'applied', 'rest', 'minute', 'soft', 'padded', 'nt', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'btw', 'purposely', 'hyaluronic', 'toner', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'phrase', 'soft', 'baby', 'slight', 'tingling', 'application', 'nt', 'unpleasant', 'abated', 'reading', 'tingling', 'sensitivity', 'level', 'niacinamide', 'barrier', 'compromised', 'not', 'application con', 'outer', 'unsealed', 'foil', 'plastic', 'seal', 'protecting', 'hesitate', 'users', 'seal', 'not', 'flat', 'missing overall', 'straight', 'win', 'holy', 'grail', 'fresh', 'exfoliation', 'hydration', 'lasts', 'package', 'decided', 'waking', 'result', 'supple', 'hydrated', 'sleep', 'humid', 'wiping', 'sunscreens', 'constantly', 'patting', 'not', 'reapply', 'matter', 'times', 'blot', 'day i', 'version', 'direct', 'u s', 'nt', 'not', 'safety', 'seal', 'idea', 'samples', 'official', 'site my', 'birthday', 'dark', 'freckles', 'aka', 'spots', 'lol', 'days', 'feels', 'supple', 'healthy', 'swear', 'spots', 'noticeable', 'nextlevel']",heard decided btw experiencing pilling flaking verify authenticity clean not freshly washed checking roche online verify marking pro light not nt peasized neck glide easily applied rest minute soft padded nt completely absorbed btw purposely hyaluronic toner pretty incredible phrase soft baby slight tingling application nt unpleasant abated reading tingling sensitivity level niacinamide barrier compromised not application con outer unsealed foil plastic seal protecting hesitate user seal not flat missing overall straight win holy grail fresh exfoliation hydration last package decided waking result supple hydrated sleep humid wiping sunscreen constantly patting not reapply matter time blot day i version direct u s nt not safety seal idea sample official site my birthday dark freckle aka spot lol day feel supple healthy swear spot noticeable nextlevel,0.9243,positive

4,"before i ordered this, i read the reviews on the stickiness of this la roche-posay hyalu b5 serum and hesitated—but, i was curious to try it so i did order it after all. i’m glad i did.it comes packaged in an aqua-colored bottle to keep light out as much as possible, and with the eye dropper separate to avoid leaking before it arrives to the consumer. the serum does look rather thick and sticky as you pull it up into the stopper.when i applied it to my face, i did see where other customer’s may have experienced a little sticky feeling, but for me, as soon as i smoothed it over my face (and a little goes a long way), it absorbed nicely into my skin. i have very little residue and very little stickiness, and what stickiness i did have is because i applied too much. i applied less the next time and had no residue or stickiness atop my skin.my skin feels soft. and, there is a light pleasing fragrance—i can’t put my finger on what it is but i like it a lot—it’s not exactly floral and has a spicy hint to it, which i like a lot. it doesn’t overpower and doesn’t stay for so long that it bothers me, but lingers just enough to make me happy.the price at just under $30 is reasonable for hyaluronic acid serums—you can pay whatever you want for face serums and creams, for they come in prices to quite low to very very expensive. i would pay this much for this b5 serum. the b’s in face creams and serums are reported to work well for call regeneration. whether there is enough in this serum to do anything remarkable i can’t answer that, but over time it certainly should help my skin. if very dramatic results are wanted, one should really consider a prescription-strength product that an over-the-counter product may not be able to deliver. but with continued consistent use, the over-the-counter products can deliver nice results.when i evaluate a face cream, serum, moisturizer, etc, i consider how it makes me feel, how it feels smoothing on my face, does it irritate my skin, the cost of the product, and are the claims it makes at any level working at all.using those guidelines with la roche-posay b5 serum:1) it makes me feel pampered. i like the ‘luxe’ feel of the serum.2) smoothing it on, it feels great, and the scent is pleasing. my skin feels soft afterward.3) there is no irritation to my sensitive skin—no itching, redness, burning.4) the cost is very reasonable for a facial serum. it compares to many other over-the-counter products like l’oreal or vichy—two of my go-to skin-care product companies.5) the claims part of what it does to my skin is the gray area, but their claims don’t seem to be very unreasonable. most all skin-care companies make these claims. since i can’t really know what’s happening on a cellular level, i turn to 1-4 and if those make me happy, then i will try the product again.i’d purchase this when it’s all gone.sticky residue if i use too much only ....",La Roche-Posay,"['read', 'reviews', 'stickiness', 'rocheposay',

i’ve been using this face wash for the past year and it’s done my skin wonders !! 😫 my skin tends to be kinda dry but slightly oily in my t zone and around my nostrils. i’m also prone to breakouts, and anything scented tends to make things worse. i could never find a skincare routine that fully worked for me and made the breakouts stop. i was putting in so much work for little results, and then i started using this stuff and let me tell you- my skin has never looked/felt so good !! at first, i noticed i was still dealing with some blemishes and almost stopped using this stuff cause i thought it was the face wash’s fault but it turns out it’s because i wasn’t using it properly (oops). make sure to use a wash cloth when washing your face! i was uneducated and didn’t realize that by not using a wash cloth, i was leaving some of the face wash trapped on my skin and it was clogging my pores and causing the pimples. so make sure to at least use a clean wash cloth when rinsing it off, if not for the entire wash and rinse process. also, this doesn’t just apply to this face wash, it’s apparently common skincare knowledge that i was just unaware of (like i said, it wasn’t the face wash’s fault y’all)! i now am happy to say that i haven’t had a breakout or uneven skin in many months. i make sure to use it twice a day, morning and night, and for me personally i apply paula’s choice pore reducing toner with a cotton pad afterwards (use toner while your skin is still wet!) and then usually vitamin c serum, a couple drops of jojoba oil, and some spf on top during the day. i dab off any extra oiliness with a paper towel (don’t rub the paper towel on your face it’s not good for your poor sensitive skin 😭) at night i wash my face, use the toner, and then some jojoba oil, rosehip seed oil, or the ordinary’s 1% retinol in squalane depending on what i feel my skin needs (also if you wanna start using a retinol serum, i highly recommend doing some research first so you know what you’re getting into/how often to use it!) overall, this stuff feels great on my face and isn’t too thick and it doesn’t leave any weird residue feeling like some face washes have in the past. it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and balanced, no more dry or oily spots! i also love that the bottle is easy to take with me places because i travel a lot. it has a cool little c shaped clip that goes under the pump to keep it from leaking in your bag which is an honest lifesaver. the bottle is durable too/it’s not about to get crushed in my bag under all my stuff. overall, i highly recommend this face wash for anyone with sensitive skin!!my favorite face wash! great for sensitive skin!",La Roche-Posay,"['media', 'not', 'loaded', 'wonders', 'kinda', 'zone', 'nostrils', 'prone', 'breakouts', 'scented', 'worse', 'breakouts', 'putting', 'lookedfelt', 'dealing', 'blemishes', 'stopped', 'fault', 'properly', 'oops', 'cloth', 'washing', 'uneducated', 'realize', 'not', 'cloth', 'leaving', 'trapped', 'clogging', 'pores', 'causing', 'pimples', 'clean', 'cloth', 'rinsing', 'not', 'entire', 'rinse', 'process', 'common', 'knowledge', 'unaware', 'fault', 'happy', 'breakout', 'uneven', 'months', 'personally', 'paula', 'choice', 'pore', 'reducing', 'toner', 'cotton', 'pad', 'toner', 'wet', 'vitamin', 'couple', 'drops', 'jojoba', 'dab', 'extra', 'oiliness', 'paper', 'towel', 'paper', 'towel', 'not', 'poor', 'toner', 'jojoba', 'rosehip', 'seed', 'ordinary', 'squalane', 'depending', 'wan', 'start', 'highly', 'recommend', 'intohow', 'feels', 'weird', 'residue', 'washes', 'leaves', 'balanced', 'spots', 'love', 'easy', 'travel', 'cool', 'shaped', 'clip', 'leaking', 'honest', 'lifesaver', 'durable', 'tooit', 'not', 'crushed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'favorite']",medium not loaded wonder kinda zone nostril prone breakout scented worse breakout putting lookedfelt dealing blemish stopped fault properly oops cloth washing uneducated realize not cloth leaving trapped clogging pore causing pimple clean cloth rinsing not entire rinse process common knowledge unaware fault happy breakout uneven month personally paula choice pore reducing toner cotton pad toner wet vitamin couple drop jojoba dab extra oiliness paper towel paper towel not poor toner jojoba rosehip seed ordinary squalane depending wan start highly recommend intohow feel weird residue wash leaf balanced spot love easy travel cool shaped clip leaking honest lifesaver durable tooit not crushed highly recommend favorite,0.9791,positive

(seriously do pores just disappear at her age?) she doesn’t even have wrinkles, except for some beautifully placed smile lines.“sure,” i mumble; clearly disheartened. “my face is freaking out. i’ve spent $100+ these last few months trying to fix it. i’ve never had an issue-before this pregnancy- & i don’t know what’s wrong with my skin!” i continue to vent hormonally, “breaking out, greasy one moment & dry & flaky the next-“she nods her head up & down as i speak, eyes shimmering in understanding behind her rimless glasses. she’s been here before.“have you tried la roche moisturizer? it’s probiotic thermal water works miracles.”i haven’t of course.my fairy godmother (for who else could this angel be?) hands me the unsuspecting bottle. $20 dollars? i scoff inwardly at the high price tag, not fully understanding yet what a gift this is.spf or no spf?

added a photo with myself wearing it cc cream, but you can see my face looks lovely. thank you fairy god mother of science. thank you**update: 2022just ordered another bottle. read some reviews & wanted to comment about the “pilling”. the pilling is dead skin….exfoliate before. i’m on my, like 10th? bottle or something. from personal experience i’ve noticed if i don’t exfoliate & just “put it on” without properly cleaning & taking care of my face-pilling will happen. i actually take it as an indication i need to take better care of my face.i wasn’t paid anything for this review.not even a “give us a good review & you get a free bottle” discount. which i am cool with.i personally take those little postcards as offensive little star-grabbing buggards messing with the review

love it)- isn’t combatting the extreme dryness of wisconsin. i needed a solution.i found the “triple repair moisturizing cream for face & body”. it’s basically the same stuff but thicker and creamier for extreme dry skin.as i’ve aged, my skin has been very hormonal.i’ve incorporated snail mucin cosrx as well. it’s been helping and my acne (scattered painful bumps that i pick at and then they
