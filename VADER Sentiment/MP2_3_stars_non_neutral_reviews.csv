3,"i like this cleanser but don't think i'll buy it again.  i would be a repeat customer based on the way it works, the lack of any off-putting scent, price, etc., but what bothers me is the safety rating given it by the environmental working group.  on their system a ""0"" means (as i understand it) that a product has no ingredients with any unhealthy aspects, whether it's allergens, carcinogens, etc., to a ""10"" which basically advises running in the opposite direction as quickly as possible.  this cerava cleanser earns a rating of ""4"" by the environmental working group, a number high enough to be a concern for me.  they show it as having no carcinogenic properties, but note other concerns.  their summary is:""other high concerns: endocrine disruption, contamination concerns, irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), persistence and bioaccumulation; other moderate concerns: biochemical or cellular level changes, organ system toxicity (non-reproductive); other low concerns: enhanced skin absorption, data gaps, ecotoxicology.""some of that might appear scarier at first glance than it does upon looking further (although i'm certainly not an expert on this stuff), e.g., re. ""irritation,"" not many soaps don't cause eye irritation, right?  that said, and although consumers need to make evaluations based on their own views, i'm not one to ignore the ewg.  that's why i'm unlikely to buy this cleanser again.in other words, i'd love this stuff if it had a better hazard rating, but given the score of 4 i think much less highly of it.works well, no off-putting scent, but i'm not happy with the ingredients",CeraVe,"['nt', 'repeat', 'customer', 'based', 'lack', 'offputting', 'bothers', 'safety', 'rating', 'environmental', 'understand', 'ingredients', 'unhealthy', 'aspects', 'allergens', 'carcinogens', 'basically', 'advises', 'running', 'direction', 'cerava', 'earns', 'rating', 'environmental', 'concern', 'carcinogenic', 'properties', 'note', 'concerns', 'summary', 'concerns', 'endocrine', 'disruption', 'contamination', 'concerns', 'irritation', 'eyes', 'lungs', 'persistence', 'bioaccumulation', 'moderate', 'concerns', 'biochemical', 'cellular', 'level', 'organ', 'toxicity', 'nonreproductive', 'concerns', 'enhanced', 'absorption', 'data', 'gaps', 'ecotoxicology', 'scarier', 'glance', 'not', 'expert', 'e g', 'irritation', 'not', 'soaps', 'nt', 'irritation', 'consumers', 'evaluations', 'based', 'views', 'not', 'ignore', 'ewg', 'again in', 'love', 'hazard', 'rating', 'score', 'highly', 'it works', 'offputting', 'not', 'happy', 'ingredients']",nt repeat customer based lack offputting bother safety rating environmental understand ingredient unhealthy aspect allergen carcinogen basically advises running direction cerava earns rating environmental concern carcinogenic property note concern summary concern endocrine disruption contamination concern irritation eye lung persistence bioaccumulation moderate concern biochemical cellular level organ toxicity nonreproductive concern enhanced absorption data gap ecotoxicology scarier glance not expert e g irritation not soap nt irritation consumer evaluation based view not ignore ewg again in love hazard rating score highly it works offputting not happy ingredient,-0.9244,negative

3,"the good: this ""serum"" really feels more lotion-like and could potentially be used on its own, unlike most hyluronic acid serums that are really about hydrating the skin, but need something to seal in that hydration besides it. it feels smooth on the skin and if you want to pare down the amount of products, this could potentially work.  when i realized all the ingredients in this (more down below), i switched to using this only in the morning, and right before my moisturizer and spf, and haven't had a problem.the bad: however, i typically like to use a separate moisturizer instead of a product like this. dimethicone is the fourth ingredient, so there's a good amount of it in here, and as a result, if you add any other active products to your skin after this serum, it will be harder/take longer for those to penetrate the barrier you've just applied to your skin. in addition, the fifth ingredient is alcohol denat, aka denatured alcohol, which can damage your own skin's barrier. it's designed to allow the other ingredients in the formula to penetrate deeper. in general, i try to avoid skincare products with denatured alcohol in them. but your mileage may vary.the bottom line: i'm a big fan of cerave products (their cleansers and most of their moisturizers are holy grail status for me), but this would be at the bottom of my list. i just don't think i'd get another one, so this would be a pass for me.formulation is key but still...",CeraVe,"['feels', 'lotionlike', 'hyluronic', 'acid', 'serums', 'seal', 'hydration', 'feels', 'smooth', 'pare', 'products', 'realized', 'ingredients', 'switched', 'nt', 'problem the', 'bad', 'typically', 'separate', 'dimethicone', 'fourth', 'result', 'add', 'active', 'products', 'hardertake', 'penetrate', 'barrier', 'applied', 'addition', 'alcohol', 'denat', 'aka', 'denatured', 'alcohol', 'damage', 'barrier', 'designed', 'ingredients', 'formula', 'penetrate', 'deeper', 'avoid', 'products', 'denatured', 'alcohol', 'mileage', 'vary the', 'fan', 'products', 'cleansers', 'holy', 'grail', 'status', 'list', 'nt', 'pass', 'me formulation', 'key']",feel lotionlike hyluronic acid serum seal hydration feel smooth pare product realized ingredient switched nt problem the bad typically separate dimethicone fourth result add active product hardertake penetrate barrier applied addition alcohol denat aka denatured alcohol damage barrier designed ingredient formula penetrate deeper avoid product denatured alcohol mileage vary the fan product cleanser holy grail status list nt pas me formulation key,-0.8225,negative

3,"i can see where people think this is an eye treatment, and i guess it is, a bit. this is way more of a concealer; it's pigmented and has some pearlized material to deflect light (and get rid of the appearance of dark circles.) although la roche-posay as a company has the reputation for a strong science component to their products, they are also a cosmetic company, and that's pretty much what this product is - a cosmetic.it does contain caffeine, which has a diuretic effect to relieve puffiness. it also boasts something called phe-resorcinol, which i guess is their own proprietary compound. resorcinol itself is an ingredient in argan oil. the company states that its own blend is ""known for its targeted action on melanin"", making it sound like this is some kind of skin whitener - all products that claim 'brightening' qualities are really talking about lightening.puffiness can cast a shadow, which can cause the appearance of dark circles. this particular product has a metal applicator. i gather the point of that, in using it to spread the concealer around, is that the cold metal will make the puffiness go away. you can get the same effect by putting a metal teaspoon in the fridge or in a glass of ice water, then using the back of the spoon to press down the puffiness (also watch salt intake, which causes water retention and adds to the puffiness.)you might think caffeine would work on dark circles, but that would depend upon the cause of the circles. some are hereditary, others can be lifestyle related (tiredness), or can come from age. if your circles have a brownish tinge, use an apricot colored pigment to counter it (this can be in a concealer or just put on the skin, then use a concealer); if your circles have a blue cast, try a yellowish concealer.this particular product is fine as a concealer, but make no mistake. this is much less of a treatment than it is a cosmetic to hide, not cure, dark circles. short of surgery and injections, nothing permanently gets rid of dark circles. but a good concealer, and knowing how to use it, isn't a bad second choice.make no mistake: this is a cosmetic concealer, not a dark circle treatment",La Roche-Posay,"['treatment', 'guess', 'concealer', 'pigmented', 'pearlized', 'material', 'deflect', 'light', 'rid', 'appearance', 'dark', 'circles', 'rocheposay', 'company', 'reputation', 'strong', 'science', 'component', 'products', 'cosmetic', 'company', 'pretty', 'cosmetic it', 'caffeine', 'diuretic', 'relieve', 'boasts', 'called', 'pheresorcinol', 'guess', 'proprietary', 'compound', 'resorcinol', 'argan', 'company', 'targeted', 'action', 'melanin', 'sound', 'whitener', 'products', 'claim', 'brightening', 'qualities', 'talking', 'lightening puffiness', 'cast', 'shadow', 'appearance', 'dark', 'circles', 'metal', 'applicator', 'gather', 'concealer', 'cold', 'metal', 'putting', 'metal', 'teaspoon', 'fridge', 'glass', 'ice', 'water', 'spoon', 'press', 'watch', 'salt', 'intake', 'water', 'retention', 'adds', 'caffeine', 'dark', 'circles', 'depend', 'circles', 'hereditary', 'lifestyle', 'tiredness', 'circles', 'brownish', 'tinge', 'apricot', 'colored', 'pigment', 'counter', 'concealer', 'concealer', 'circles', 'blue', 'cast', 'yellowish', 'concealer this', 'fine', 'concealer', 'mistake', 'treatment', 'cosmetic', 'hide', 'not', 'cure', 'dark', 'circles', 'short', 'surgery', 'injections', 'permanently', 'rid', 'dark', 'circles', 'concealer', 'knowing', 'nt', 'bad', 'choice make', 'mistake', 'cosmetic', 'concealer', 'not', 'dark', 'circle', 'treatment']",treatment guess concealer pigmented pearlized material deflect light rid appearance dark circle rocheposay company reputation strong science component product cosmetic company pretty cosmetic it caffeine diuretic relieve boast called pheresorcinol guess proprietary compound resorcinol argan company targeted action melanin sound whitener product claim brightening quality talking lightening puffiness cast shadow appearance dark circle metal applicator gather concealer cold metal putting metal teaspoon fridge glass ice water spoon press watch salt intake water retention add caffeine dark circle depend circle hereditary lifestyle tiredness circle brownish tinge apricot colored pigment counter concealer concealer circle blue cast yellowish concealer this fine concealer mistake treatment cosmetic hide not cure dark circle short surgery injection permanently rid dark circle concealer knowing nt bad choice make mistake cosmetic concealer not dark circle treatment,0.6908,positive
